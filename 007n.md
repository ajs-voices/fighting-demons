Nox took the bottle as the bartender was about to hand it to Jacinda.  He may be a rough-neck hunter, but he was raised to treat a woman right too.  His dad would shoot him if he treated a woman poorly.  He didn't consider not calling not treating her right, cause he wasn't with her anymore.  When Ms. Right came around that would be a completely another story, and so far Nox hadn't seen hide nor hair of that elusive beast.

Nox got the door for Jacinda, and held the elevator for her.  He smiled as he pushed the button to the top floor.  He'd paid good money for this, he was glad he was taking a high caliber girl to his room instead of some ditz of a girl he probably would have met later.

Nox was disapointed the elevator wasn't empty he watched Jacinda move, she was not his typical catch, but he wasn't going to compare her to the girls he'd been with in the past, none of them would compare, not even the drop dead gorgeous ones.  

He never got a break as the top floor opened, the last man scurried out.  He looked like he was late for a very important date.  Nox laughed to himself.  Stupid Alice in wonderland references getting stuck in his head today.  Nox put his arm around Jacinda and lead her to his room.  Thankfully far enough away from the elevator not to be a burdern on those traveling the halls.  He didn't know if she were a screamer or not.  One could hope.

Nox slid the key into the card reader and the green light blinked on and he pushed the door open.  "Home sweet, home.  At least for the night."  He pointed the direction to his room.  "I'm there."  And nodded towards the other door. "Aria's over there.  She shouldn't be back for a few hours, we can use the main room for a while."

**** Jacinda ****

Nox had a suite, it seemed. He was in a hurry to get to the room. She didn't blame him. Course, he had no idea.

She looked over at Aria's room. Too bad. But maybe another time. They went into Nox's room and stood by the bed. Jacinda let the moment draw out. The kid wasn't shy, of course, but starting from nothing- they'd not been all over each other in the elevator or anything- was gonna take a bit. At least, she needed to get her engines going.

She smiled wickedly and decided to set the mood. She went in and began playfully kissing him lightly on the lips, on the cheek, on the neck. She let his hands begin to wander too. Let him relax, think he knew how things would go. As he got a little more heated, she suddenly threw him on he bed and straddling him, pinned his hands and shoulders. "Sorry, hun. I don't go so easily. You're gonna have to earn it." And then, jumping back, she got into fighting stance. It wasn't going to be a real fight. At least nothing that involved punching and bleeding. At least not much anyway.

She smiled at him. "Well doll? If you want this, you better come get it."

**** Nox ****

Nox hadn't exactly expected the turn of events.  He was slightly taken aback when he literally was lying on it staring up with Jacinda perched on top of him.  He hadn't expected to fight for his supper either.  He grinned at her, he almost said 'And if I don't?' but he'd play her game.  Nox really wanted this notch on his headboard so to speak.

If it was a game she wanted, then it was a game she'd get.  Nox sat up and looked at her imagining what she was like underneath those clothes.  It was the prize afterall to get her out of them, and into his nice neatly made bed.  

Nox bent down and untied one shoe, and then the other.  He purposely went slow.  He kicked them off and pushed them under the bed.  No need for obstacles to get in the way of the fun.  Nox stood up and shook his body like he would before a match with Bas.  This was a whole other type of match, one to which he doubted he'd win, and he was pretty sure he had to keep his secret weapon - secret.

Nox lunged for her and she deftly moved out of the way.  She wasn't going to make it easy and Nox really wished he could use his power.  He pulled on it, it fueld his fight, the tempataion was there to use it but he just held on to it.  Everything in the dark room was clear as day.  He could smell her from this distance.  He feel the current of from the air units blowing through the room on his skin.  He could see the peircing stare of her eyes even though the light was dim.  He grinned at her.

He moved one way and she went the other, Nox smiled as he redirected in mid stream.  The power didn't make him quicker, nor smarter, just to see each tiny detail as it happened.  He grabbed her arms but she twisted her arms and threw him backwards.  He caught one arm of hers and twisted pulled her to him, they toppled to the floor her landing on top of him.  He grinned at her and kiss her lips.  She bit his, then pinned him to the floor with her knees.  Nox struggled but there was little effort in it, he was glad to be in the position he was in looking up at her.

The power raged in his body, his arosal was clear and she knew it all to well.  The smile on her face said they weren't done yet.  Nox used his legs and pushed up from his midsection sending Jacinda head first over his head.  

Nox got up quickly but she was already back on her feet.  Nox grinned at her.  But he was tiring of the game.  It was one thing to want to get laid, and another to have to work this hard at it.

Jacinda lunghed at Nox and they fell to the bed.  Nox's heart was pounding and he could feel her's in her chest.  He could see the pulse in her neck raging.  He kissed her and she kissed him back harder.  Jacinda pinned Nox's hands above his head and pushed herself against him.  The fight was done, he had no problem letting her know she was his better.  He moved against her and she let him go.  His hands ran through her hair and he grabbed a handful and rolled her over. He took off his shirt before he ran his hands along her shirt and took it off. 

Nox finished removing both of their clothes before he found himself back on the bottom, she was done letting him do for her.  She hadn't been kidding when had joked with Aria about taking him for a ride.  She rode him hard and he had to drop the power or lose everything before he was ready.  

The world went dim, things grew dark, he felt less and it was still awesome.  He grabbed a fistful of hair and pulled her around again.  He wanted the control for at least part of the time.  Most girls liked it, Nox didn't care if she did, she'd just take it back anyway.

He kissed her hard on the lips and then her neck and down until he was between her legs.  Jacina didn't fight him as he brought her with his fingers and tongue.  He was satisfied now, he kissed his way up to her and kissed her on the lips as he pushed himself inside again.  

Nox embraced the power, he wanted every last feeling to round out the night.  He moved and she countered and it was as much a dance as a fight.  He let out a final moan at the moment of release and once spent collapsed to the side.  He could still walk, for now.  He didn't think he could do another round with foreplay like that.  His body ached still from the plane crash, the doctors said it would for some time.  


**** Jacinda ****

She laughed when he was done. He'd done ok for a first round. He was breathing pretty hard, which surprised her. You'd think a young punk like this would just be getting going. She knew that she was just beginning. Already, she tingled down below, all excited and frisky. She'd gotten a taste and it had taken her to the first step. It would be interesting how many steps he'd take her up. But she was willing to give him a moment or two to recover. She wanted a towel anyway, at least to clean up. She'd need it again later, but for now it would be enough.

He was laying against her chest, his whiskered cheek on her breasts. "Well, kiddo, that's a way to celebrate, aye? But don't think you are done. We're just getting started." As she spoke she caressed his back, up and down. He'd take a moment, but he'd be ready soon enough. And if not, she had ways to get him back up.

**** Nox ****

Nox rolled his eyes.  He could play dead.  But he was game.  Though he did think it prudent to tell her before she broke him in the most literal sense, "I suppose now isn't a good time to tell you that I fell out of a plane not too long past and I'm still healing."  He grinned as got up and got a drink of water and tossed her a towel. "Give me a few and I'll be back in the game so long as it's not another fight you want."

The only water was that in the cup or the god aweful expesive bottles that sat in the fridge.  He took the bottle to the night stand after a long swig, she didn't waste time for him to get back in the game.  She pulled him closer and her mouth went around him and his eyes rolled back in his head.  Nox imagined he looked like that stupid oaf from that olden goldy cartoon after eating a doughnut.

Nox manuervered himself to her and returned the favor.  There really was no point in not sharing.  And their evening progressed this way until Nox was consumed with it.  His body ached in every possible place, and she wasn't done yet.  

Nox had lost track of what round they were on, three, four, five, his mind was reeling from it all.  Jacinda was an animal, he liked it very much, loved everything about her in the bedroom.  His wallet started ringing and he ignored it.  Jacinda even threw it across the room, it landed in a pile of clothes, thankfully, Nox was pretty sure the Regus wouldn't be happy to replace the brand new wallet.  The clothes muffled the sound and kept the flashing at bay.

And then there was a knock, and Aria's voice followed.  He was actually relieved to her her voice, she sounded annoyed too.  And Aria didn't wait for him to say anything before she opened the door.

**** Jacinda ****

What a night. The kid kept up pretty well. Enough that she felt satisfied. Course she was game for maybe a bit more but that damn phone kept going. And then the knocking and Aria came in. She was on top of Nox, riding him, and stopped. She smirked at him before turning to Aria. She wasn't embarressed in the slightest. If anything, she enjoyed the widening of Aria's eyes. Sent a thrill through her. There was something about someone watching you. She moved slowly, almost imperceptibly, though of course Nox was probably going crazy. Then again, he might just be glad for the slight break. She hadn't been joking about what she was going to do.

"Girl, you have impeccable timing. I think Nox is running out of steam. Did you come in to spell him?" She looked back and winked at Aria. She was game of course, though she was sure that was not what her interruption was about. Still, she stared at Aria, demanding an answer.

****  Aria ****

It wasn't a surprise to see them still going at it, she'd known what they were doing for the most part, but Jacinda didn't exactly stop or have a fit as she'd have expected instead she felt the excitement roll through her with an audience.  Aria noticed the black dragon tattoo on Jacinda's back, she grinned at her, one of Nox's annoying ones.  Nox squirmed inside, he wasn't exactly shy, but he wasn't exactly interested in being watched either.  Aria's smile widened and he was red pretty much head to toe.  Aria laughed.  

She smirked at Jacinda's comment.  She had NO idea how exhausted he was, but Aria did.  "I'm good thanks."  She smiled at Nox.  "Laptop?"

He pointed in the general vicinity and Aria caught sight of it and picked up the bag.  Aria smiled at the both of them.  "I'll leave you to it."  Aria grinned evilly as she picked up Nox's phone.  "I'll take this so your sister doesn't interrupt you."  Nox fumed at her inside, knowing she could feel it.  Aria laughed on the way out, closing the door behind her.  Teach him.


**** Nox ****

Aria walked in, and Jacinda slowed to a near halt, _come on_.  Aria watched and that made the whole situation even worse.  It felt wonderful and was torture all at the same time.  And she knew exactly what he was feeling, he couldn't help the rush of blood that turned his skin a nice shade of pink.  And then she laughed, she was enjoying it.  He didn't blame her, not really, he'd have done the same if the tides were turned. The thought was definitely arousing.

Nox tried to grab for the power as he pointed out the laptop, it was no where to be found it sat at the edge of his vision taunting him.  It was probably a good idea, he couldn't control it to the degree he needed to with a bad-ass hunter moving every so slowly on top of him.  

Aria left with as much ceremony as she had enter, taking the only bloody interruption he had left.  He prayed this night would end before he broke, quite literally.  In a last ditch effort to regain some of his manliness he reached up and grabbed her by her hair and pulled her over and finshed them both off in a haze of glory.

He literally collapsed on top of her.  "If you want more, Duckling, you are going to have find yourself another horse.  You've about run me into the ground."

**** Jacinda ****

Jacinda laughed as he finished. She'd been close and his being forceful with her had been enough to send her over the edge. They were covered in sweat and bodies were slick; the room smelled of sweat and sex. She relished the feeling. He'd done a good job.

She looked down at the top of his head, rising and falling with their panting. She stretched and felt that delicious feeling of sore muscle and fullness and satisfaction from groil to buttocks, from stomach to shoulder. She flexed her feet and toes and felt alive everywhere. "You did good sweetling. Good enough." She tilted his head up so she could look at him. "Like a colt, learning to walk. You'll do better tomorrow." Her smile was wicked. He was going to be hurting tomorrow. He'd remember her. And if she was honest, she was going to be a bit sore. It had been a good game.

She swatted the back of his head. "Up now, Colt. Let me up. I need to clean up." When she was up, she looked down at him. He was sweet looking. Almost....almost she thought about one more ride. But from the looks of him, he was finished for the night. She was good. She could wait. Let him watch her ass as she walked to the bathroom, burning into his memory. She might be 45 but she knew that she was as lithe and taut as...well as Aria was. Idly, she wondered how that might go. She had enjoyed Aria seeing her. She breathed in contentedly. Yeah, this was going to be fun.

After cleaning up she'd find out what had been so damned important.

**** Aria ****

Aria took the laptop and cleared a spot on the coffee table and opened her wallet and called Aurora back.  She pulled the towel off her head, it was annoying.  She put the wallet on holo mode and started the laptop up.

Aria grinned as she felt the last of their passion fade.  Nox was completely spent, but he was the first one out of the room with nothing but his boxers on and a bottle of water.  He plopped down on the couch behind, he fell rather laying behind her as Aurora answered the phone.  

His sister was nothing like him.  The blond hair blue eyes against his dark, there was very little resemblence.  Aria expected she looked like her mother. Aurora laughed, "Don't you two look cozy."

Nox laughed.  "Not funny.   His head fell backwards and Aria laughed.

"Go to sleep I can do this."  Aria was capable of talking and relaying messages.  
Nox grinned at her, but it didn't reach his eyes, he was truly well and done.  He didn't move as he spoke to his sister.  "What's up Aurora that you had to bother both of us."  Nox rubbed Aria's wet hair with his hand.  "You apparently interrupted both of us."

Aria put an elbow in his stomach.  He bent over in mock pain.  "Careful Duckling."  Aria hit him harder this time in the same spot.

He laughed, but Aurora spoke before he could say anything else.  "You get the files?" 

Nox pulled the laptop to him reaching around Aria.  "Yea we got them.  Ms slow poke here, all the training in the world and she hates most tech."

"There. We see it.  What is it?"  Nox asked.

"That's what you need to find out.  Strange reports in that area.  Weird things, not monsters, more like godling type stuff."

Jacinda walked out of Nox's room with a pair of plaid boxers and white t-shirt.  Aria gave her an admiring look as she sat down pushing Nox's feet up making Nox sit up.  He groaned.  "Aurora, Jacinda Cross.  Jacinda, this is Aurora, Nox's twin sister and the reason we were all interrupted."

Aurora blushed on the holo, she muttered an apology before she cleared her throat.  "A pleasure.  I was just telling these two traveling carnival freaks that there is a very weird sighting out in New York.  No idea what it could be.  Potential godling stuff.  Don't want anyone getting hurt.  I know it's not your typical game, but ya'll are heading back that way to head back here.  And I've plotted a few other sightings for you so you can get your hunt on.  I know the two of you so very much love it.  I'll see ya'll soon.  Don't be mean Nox."

Nox laughed and hung up the wallet.  "And that's my sister, all books and no play.  Seems we won't be hitting you up for any hunting."  He grined, "Unless you want to come along."

**** Jacinda ****

She came out in her shorts and t-shirt and shoved Colt over so she could take a seat, putting her feet up on the table. She listened, laughing at the image that flashed to her mind. A movie she'd seen as a kid. Three girls sitting around a speaker listening to some guy- Carl? Chester?- giving them cases to work. It had been stupid but entertaining.

Aurora seemed to be more serious. Not it a stuffy bad way. It's just that she wasn't here and so wasn't able to banter in person. Her news, though, put smiles on everyone's faces, hers included. And then Aurora signed off. She did have a sense of humor, though Aurora didn't know that she should've told Jacinda to play nice.

She smiled at Nox's invitation. "As if you two could stop me. Of course I'm going with you. Been a while since I've had a good partner, let alone two." She looked them both over. Course, she really didn't know anything about them. But she had an eye for people. Could tell who was brag and who was for real. And they weren't brag. They didn't need to. They knew what they were about. A proper team. Be nice to do that again. With her in charge, of course.

"So, what are the details? What are we looking for?"

****  Nox ****

Nox grinned at the nickname, turn about was fair play.  He smiled as she walked away.  But that was about all he could do.  He really just wanted to pass out, but Aurora had thought it important, he might as well get up.  He pulled on a pair of boxers and fell on to the couch squeezing behind Aria.  She hadn't even gotten set up yet.  Aurora answered and they got the low down on everything.  It was good to be back on task though instead of wandering around like they had been.  He guessed he wouldn't get to show Aria the west coast and maybe get a wave in or two, but he'd rather hunt.

Jacinda came out and Aria looked her over good.  He wondered if Lucas knew what his girlfriend thought of women.  Jacinda pushed him out of the way, and he had to sit up, it hurt to move.  Aurora pushed a bit too close with Jacinda sitting right there, hopefully the whole carnival freaks didn't point any flags their direction.  Last thing they needed was a bad-ass, unstoppable hunter hunting them.  Lucas would kill him if he got Aria hurt, or killed.

Nox invited Jacinda along, Aria didn't question it, but Jacinda was game and they could probably learn a lot from her.  She wanted details.  Nox wanted his bed.  He leaned over and kissed Aria on the forehead.  "Not my thing. Sweet dreams Duckling.  I'm going to bed."  He got up and walked past Aria and leaned over and kissed Jacinda on the cheek.  "You are welcome to crash in my bed.  But I'm not taking the couch."  

And Nox went into his bedroom, turned out the light and crashed.  

**** Aria ****

Aria wasn't too sure Nox had really given it much thought, letting Jacinda in on their hunt.  He wasn't going to be able to fight like he wanted.  Maybe it was part of the challenge, but the only thing she got of Nox was sore and exhausted.  Aria grinned, he'd be paying for it in the morning.  Jacinda too if her body read the same way.

Nox kissed her on the forehead and wished her sweet dreams Duckling, Aria would have hit him again, but he hadn't meant any offense by it, for once, and in reality with her it wasn't ever meant to be demeaning.  

Aria sent the files to her wallet, it would be easier to show on the holo set up she had.  Aria didn't exactly like sharing the thoughts, she was surprised she worked as well in a team with Nox and Aurora, but they were more amenable to her way of thinking so there wasn't a clash too much.  Aurora and Nox definitely got along better now that they weren't hunting together.

When all the files had been received Aria threw them all up in holo mode.  It always reminded her of the old science fiction tech of Tony Stark.  It made everything a lot bigger and much easier to scan through.

Aria set the wallet on the table.  She stood up and walked around it and started sorting the files, "Aurora is thorough.  There will be things here we don't care about."

She was talking to herself really.  But she let her thoughts out so Jacinda could at least get her train of thought. Aria dragged a file to the center and made it bigger. The article in the center described an old ancient artifact that had been uncovered in the Apalachian mountains.  They didn't know what it was, or what it could do.  It was broken, they figured it didn't work.  

Aria had started scanning in her books into her wallet.  So they could become part of the material on her screens.  It was the only thing she could do since Katya had passed and her hacking days were done.  She never did get those land warriors back.  Oh well.

Aria pulled up the oldest journal she had scanned it.  It had been the first one she'd done, just in case things went wonky, that material was saved.  Eventually she'd learn to put her own entries here with out the paper.  It made life easier.  But she was still getting the hang of having this much tech at her finger tips.

She started a scan of the object in that book.  It would at least tell her if it might possibly be a god artifact from the day back in the wars.

Aria looked at Jacinda and smiled, "It might take a while to see if there is anything like it in my journals."

Aria pulled up the map Aurora had sent.  She'd mapped out their travel destination with stops along the way.  There were two.  Aria touched the destination, Aurora was a clever girl and all files linked to that job would pop to the top.  And Aria was correct.  She hid the rest for now and only those on the screen were for the final job, the rest were standard jobs, one looked to be line an oni.  That would be a test with Nox's abilities in hiding.

"This is everything Aurora sent on that mystery task.  I'm sure every hunter in the United States is going to be there."  

**** Jacinda ****

Jacinda settled down to listen. She was tired. A hunt, a lot of drinks, some rousing marathon sex after a good bout of wrestling. Now that she was sitting on the couch, she found that tiredness had washed over her. Aria went over the details for the main hunt and the ones that they could do on the way. She was thorough. She said Aurora was the thorough one but apparantly, she didnt recognize it in herself.

Her eyes closed but she said "I'm listening." And she did, with half-an-ear. The other half thought about what she had learned. The girl had taken on an Ijiraq and won. She'd not faced one of those before. She'd have to ask her what the strategy was for dealing with them. And a drainaka. Damn but this girl must be getting a reputation with kills like that in the bag.

She was good- damn good!- but still there was that struggle. She remembered back to her own struggle. It was after Regan- her world, her anchor, her lover, her father, her friend- was killed by the roug that she finally- finally- had won the struggle. These things were not human, no matter how they appeared. Mercy and empathy were not part of the equation. They had no place for a hunter.

Truth was, what they did was far too important to allow sentiment into it. Even a human who posed a threat or interefered had to be taken care of. It was sad, but in this kind of war, collateral damage happened. It was regretable but she'd do it without question if it was required.

Aria was a good hunter. Once she came to terms with things, she'd be better. Jacinda thought that it could almost have been fate- if she believed in that sort of thing- that had made them cross paths. Jacinda was far down the road that Aria was now walking. She'd be able to give her the help she'd never gotten.

She opened her eyes and watched Aria, not with the predatory way she had before. But instead to know her better, to see where she could help. The girl would be one of the best. Who knew? Maybe even the two of them would be partners. That would be something. A team unlike the world had ever seen. Creatures of the night would quake in their boots. She smiled at the thought, and gradually drifted off.

**** Aria ****

Aria rambled on, it wasn't really important to go over things now but she'd asked and now Aria was going.  Aria lived for the hunt.  Since meeting Nox and then Aurora, the way a hunt went was much nicer, still had the same feeling once going, but it wasn't her alone anymore.  They got her, she got them.  It was all good.

Aria watched as Jacinda drifted off to sleep.  Aria slipped into her room and got her things.  She didn't think sleep would come, she had plenty to think on.  And the bath had been rejuvinating.

Aria gently shook Jacinda's legs, she wasn't getting close to a deadly hunter, at least not anymore than she had to anyway, waking sleeping hunters was a good way to find a dagger in your head.

When Jacinda opened her eyes. Aria nodded towards her room, "You can take my bed.  I've not used it."  Well she had, but the sheets were still fresh.  If Aria grew tired the couch would do fine or she'd crash with Nox, it wasn't the first time they'd shared the bed when funds were low.  And he was sleeping peacefully.  His dreams were vivid with emotion, but they were low key compared to waking emotions.

Aria waded through the files and practice her sword tai chi style, slow, controlled movements without the sword.  She did both it was calming and informative.  They'd wake refreshed and Aria could nap while they drove.  Provided Nox let her sleep, he'd make her stay up just in spite.  But she doubted he be in the mood for many games.

Aria was sure there would be an arguement in the morning, the mode of transportation was going to be an interesting discussion.

At 7:30 am Aria ordered enough breakfast for three.  They knocked at the door precisely at 8am.  Aria heard Nox's alarm go off as she answered the door to take care of it.  She tipped the woman and smiled.  "Thanks."

Aria pushed the little cart towards the coffee table and lifted the lid, it at least smelled good.  Coffee was not something she drank, but she made a pot anyway.  Nox did.   

**** Nox ****

The alarm went off and Nox found that he wanted to go back to bed, but he smelled brewing coffe.  I love you, Aria.  She must not have slept, or was up early.  Who knew with her.

They had travel plans to make, he should probably get on finding a ride for his ride.  He intended to ship his car overseas, and he'd been procrastinating, maybe Aurora would be better suited to that job.  He'd have to call her and ask.  But coffee, he wanted that.  

A knock came at the door, followed by a prompt Aria bearing a cup of hot coffee.  She smiled and Nox sat up as he took the scalding hot cup in his hand and slipped little on his chest.  Damnit!  

Aria looked on with sympathy.  He grinned at her.  "I'll be out in a bit, Jacinda up?"

Aria shook her head. "Not yet."  And she left flipping the light on.  She got him as much as he got her, and yet they worked well as a team.

Nox sipped at the coffee and then decided it was best to get dressed, but first a shower.  He was quick about it, he knew Aria probably wanted to use it too and he was pretty sure Jacinda wasn't sleeping on the couch.  

Nox pulled on clean clothes, they'd have to hit a landromat at some point, he was running out of clean clothes.  He may live on the road, but he wasn't a bum!

Aria knocked again, she came in carrying a bundle of cloth, she grinned at him.  She always seemed to know when was a good or bad time to show up.  Aria closed the door behind her, this was a private affair, Nox smiled and wondered what she had in there that was door closed material.    She handed the bundle to him.  "Aurora and I thought this was a good idea, just in case you couldn't use your prefered weapon."

Nox was intriqued by the thought, they were supposed to be keeping their skills, all their skills secret, he hadn't thought what he was going to use while Jacinda was around.  He smiled proudly, his girls thought of everything.  He laughted at "his girls" they weren't his, and if they could read his thoughts, he'd be dead by now.  He laughed to himself, Aria cocked her head to the side wondering what he was laughing at.  "You don't wanna know."

Nox moved the cloth wrapping from the top to the sides, inside a coil of leather was sitting.  He laughed.  "You two did this?"  He took the whip by the handle and picked it up and let the tail fall to the floor.

Aria nodded. "We did, we made it, Aurora found the instructions, we both took turns braiding it over a few weeks when we had time.  It's not perfect, but it'll do.  It's not as long as what you are used to, you'll have to practice a bit.  A stop in the mountains on the way out, a camping trip and some sparring might be in order."

Nox grinned madly, he loved it.  It felt right.  He hugged Aria and she smiled up at him before leaving him alone with his new toy.  He was so tempted to try it now, but he knew better, he'd break something and he couldn't afford to fix anything.

They even had a little belt hooky thing.  They were sweet.  And smart!  But he wouldn't tell either them that.  Nox strung it through his belt and slipped it on.  It would take time getting used to having it hanging there.  His leather jacket was not long enough to cover it, not that he intended to wear it outside of hunting like Aria did.  She was never without a weapon.  Not once.

Nox gathered his things and packed it up all nice and neat and walked out of his room and dropped everything by the door and sat down on the couch and pulled the lids off all the food on the cart.  He was ravenous.  Aria had everything up on the holo screens of her wallet.  Her and Aurora had been doing some work on that too, Aria's sense for organization amazed him, even Aurora wasn't that well organized.  

Nox ate and looked at the screens, reading from where he sat drinking his coffee and eating just about everything on the cart including the disgusting cantaloupe.

**** Jacinda ****

Jacinda awoke with just a bit of a headache. And she felt sore...that delicious soreness that came after a good and strenuous work-out. And that yesterday had been. The bed was nice and soft, not something she, as a hunter, was used to. But she didn't mind indulging herself from time to time. There was no need to always be hard and all work. Life was also about the little things. She stretched and flexed muscles in thighs and quads and shins and feet and toes and buttocks, feeling the soreness. Her neck and back popped next as she twisted. Despite the wrestling, she wasn't too sore in the arms and chest.

She lay there for a moment, feeling the cool of the pillow around her head. Gradually, the muffled sound of talking came through the door. What perked her up, though, was the smell of food. She sat up and let hersef catch a moment. Head wasn't really bad at all. If they had orange juice she'd feel better. She got up, feeling the soft cool carpet on her feet, and padded to the door and opened it. Aria was there with a plate and her wallet displaying something- their next hunt probably- while Nox was on the couch with a couple trays of food. She smiled at them and went over to the cart and without asking, took at covered plate. She also poured a glass of very cold orange juice as well as water, the beads of condensation already sliding down the side. She then went to the couch and sat down next to Nox, plate in hand.

"Hope you slept well, Colt." She smiled at the image of a newborn foal on shakey legs near its mother. "And that your legs worked when you got out of bed." She laughed and dug into her food- eggs and bacon and biscuits and gravy. She ate ravenously. She was a big woman and worked hard. She ate real breakfasts. Especially after a day like yesterday. As she ate, she waited for one of them to speak.

**** Nox ****

Jacinda walked out still in her boxers and t-shirt.  She looked like she'd just woken up.  He grinned at her as he sat down and she quipped about his legs.  "I'm good Duckling, ready to go again."  He laughed.

Aria shook her head.  "No he's not, not the way he's eating."  Nox gave her a mock glare, she was teasing him.  Aria grabbed her bag and headed into his room.  He knew she'd want the bathroom, he smiled at her with a nod as she 'asked' permission.  "Gonna use your shower."

Nox grinned, "Course, the bath is not as glorious as yours.  You get a chance to use it."

Aria laughed. "I did, but unfortunately I let it get cold before I actually used it."

She'd called Lucas.  He nodded knowingly and she shut the door behind her. 

Between mouthfuls, "I assume you have a ride of your own.  If you are coming with, we have to do details.  I have room for you and your gear.  Two cars sticking together from coast to coast is gonna draw attention.   I need mine back east so she can get on a ship to the CCD.  I hate not having her around.  Aria and I can chip in to get you back here and retreive your ride."

**** Jacinda ****

She listened to Aria and Nox's exchange. More than anything else, they sounded like siblings. Not that she'd had any. But there was no real sexual tension between them. In Jacinda's mind, that meant sibling-like. Then again, what did she know. Didn't really matter anyway.

To Nox's question, "I can leave it behind in Fresno. There's an airport there. That way when we're done, I can fly right in and pick it up. As for money, sweety, I do alright. It may not be as organized as the CCD side of things, but we take care of each other." She paused. He was American. Why she associated him with the Old-World style Atharim surprised her for a moment. It was Aria. She seemed to run things and she wasn't American. That had been the source of the confusion.

She was curious about that side of things. "Been a few American's who headed out east. Seth Marx. His niece Rune. Seth was a good friend of mine. Good partner too, back before he became an uncle." Seth had been a good man to hunt with. Good for a ride afterwards too. They had made quite a name in those early days. A little soft at times. Ok, more than a little. His sister getting possessed by a wefuke while pregnant? That was something. That he took on her unborn child, to raise her as his own...well, she'd probably not done that. The girl turned out alright. A good hunter even. Seth had never really gotten over her attitude about the baby though. It had soured their friendship. He had been right....but he could have been wrong. The potential danger was high. She knew how she would've decided.

But she was curious to see how old world CCD led Atharim did. America was still open and wild, for the most part, despite the dense population centers. Still indepedent too. Interesting to see how they did here.

She'd finished breakfast and felt energized. She wanted a shower- the sweat and lovemaking from last night was still on her. "I'm going to get cleaned up." She smiled at him wickedly. She was not inviting him. He'd do for later, but she wasn't in the mood. She was satiated for the time being. Let Nox earn it.

**** Aria ****

Aria finished her shower, she hadn't been completely disgusting after the bath, but she had no idea when they would hit a shower again.  It was short, but the water was hot.  It felt good, she was going to miss hot water for awhile she was sure.

Aria pulled on her clothes.  She sighed, clean clothes were getting limited.  It was the worst part about being on the road.  She disliked sleeping in the car, but the having to stop at a public place to do her laundry, Aria shuddered.

Everything was packed neatly, she strapped the sword to the top of her bag, and put the gun at her back.  It would have to do, travel sucked.  Aria missed Moscow.  She was glad she didn't have to travel much, she wondered if Nox would be happy in Moscow.  She'd traveled some while under Father Dimitri but not often and it was never long term like this.  It seemed they were always on the road.  

Aria left Nox's room.  They'd have to head out soon, they didn't have the funds to pay for a second night in this joint.  Nox was ready, he was still eating.  Aria smiled as she picked a piece of bacon from his plate.  He growled and Aria pat him on the head.  "Down boy."  He bit at her then grinned.  

"You set?"  He asked between bites.

Aria nodded, "As good as it goes I guess."

"Good.  Jacinda will ride with us after Fresno, that cool?"  Nox asked when he finished his last mouthful of food.  His plate looked rather empty, and he was searching the cart for more.  Aria hadn't seen him eat like this
