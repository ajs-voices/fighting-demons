**** Nox ****

Once Jacinda was ready they headed out.  Nox paid the final bill to which he was surpised had been partially taken care of by Aria when she had ordered room service.  Thoughtful, though he was prepared to pay for it.  He'd have to thank her later.

They let Jacinda lead the way to Fresno, he and Aria following behind in his Jeep.  It had been his fathers.  It had been new, he actually remembered the day his dad had bought.  The piece of junk they had prior had given out and they were expecting him to come home with yet another piece of junk, instead he came back with a brand new never been driven, it had like 6 miles on it.  There were uncountable miles now, the odometer had rolled over several years ago.

Nox wasn't great with cars, but he kept this one running after his father had passed.  It was a few years old, he didn't care, it had been modified since that first day.  Plenty of hidden compartments for weapons and other things.  The color had faded from the nice shiny blue it was, but it was still pretty. 

The Fresno airport was in sight and they were all fixing to be in one car.  It ought to be interesting.  Nox hoped things went well.  Jacinda seemed the take charge kinda person, what he and Aria had going was a team built on trust, and they couldn't trust her any father than either of them could throw her.  She was a hunter, and if she knew their secrets, well they'd both be in trouble.  Thankfully Aria was trained Furia, it said Furia on her file.  Aria still had some of her talents available to her.  But it would be hard to explain the other things that could happen.

They pulled into the airport long term parking.  Jacinda parked her car and Nox waited behind her to get things situated.  

**** Jacinda ****

Jacinda drove her truck, an old 2030 Toyota Tacoma. She had bought it after running Regan's Dodge pretty much into the dirt. Not much in the way of American cars by then, what with Detroit having imploded. But Toyota still made a decent one. And it had lasted for 15 years mostly because she took good care of it, like all her tools. Wasn't a lot she didn't know how to handle after 30 years in the field. She knew the country like the back of her hand. The Imperial Valley had become a lush verdant place in the years following the coastal devastation and Fresno had become a major center. The airport there was international so she'd be able to fly in from anywhere.

She parked in long terms and began unloading the stuff she figured she'd need. She hated leaving it- along with its bed storage boxes- but she understood the situation. Still, after looking around to make sure that airport parking security wasn't around- and having parked directly underneath a camera so as to minimize what security could see- she unloaded a few shotguns, a buttload of amunition, camping supplies and food, traps, hi-tech comm equipment, solar and kinetic chargers, her laptop and cloned spare, and a couple of changes of clothing. She'd packed pretty densely and it all fit pretty nicely in the back of Nox's jeep. There wasn't much room, but it fit, with some finagling.

She didn't care much for sitting in the back seat and said so. "Listen up girly"- to Aria- "I'm a sight taller than you and my legs don't like being cramped. A problem if I take the front seat?"

**** Aria ****

The ride to Fresno was typical for her and Nox, except the following Jacinda part.  Nox was never in a rush, he drove to drive and was never hurried about it.  They chatted, Aria flipped through her wallet of information, Nox blasted whatever station came in, the windows down and her hair had to be tied back so it didn't fly all over. 

They pulled into the long term parking.  Aria was fixing to get out and climb in the back.  Nox grabbed her arm and shook his head with a grin.  "Let her ask, you aren't beneath her."

Aria sat back down.  Jacinda actually asked for the front seat, Aria wanted to sleep, and keeping Nox company while enjoyable, she'd stayed up on purose so she could sleep during the day.  It was preferrable.

Aria smiled.  "No problem."  Aria hopped out of the car and crawled into the back seat, put on a her headset, and grabbed a pillow.  Before Aria flipped on her own music she heard Nox laugh.  "She was going to do that anyway.  I wanted to see what you'd do."

Aria drifted off to sleep.

**** Nox ****

Aria slept in the backseat, but Jacinda didn't have any inclination.  She talked a lot.  He supposed it was a side affect of hunting alone for too long.  He wouldn't know that feeling though, he'd not been alone for more than a few months his entire life, and those months were the longest in his memory, without his memory the world was chaos, at least now it was clear.  He still had gaps, he'd have gaps forever more than likely, but he remembered most of the important things now.

Nox tried to drive.  Try being the key word, Jacinda kept giving him instructions.  Go faster, This is a better route.  Do this, do that.  It was beginning to drive Nox up a wall.  Almost literally speaking.  He didn't think he was one to upset easily but this woman, was grating on his nerves.  She was a know it all.  He understood she was older, more experienced, but he wasn't a daft imbeicle either.  Nox grabbed for the power, he knew he couldn't use it.  But it was there, he wove a weave in front of him, it was nothing but it was calming, at least it should have been, he fumed inside, while putting on the happy face, his I'm cool, you can't phase me.

Nox felt Aria put her hand on his shoulder and she sent calming feelings, it helped.  It gave him some clarity.  He pulled over to the side of the road.  "If you think you can do better, you drive."

Nox didn't wait for an answer, he got out of the drivers seat, his seat and walked around the front of the Jeep and waited for her to move or get out.  He didn't care either way, as long as she moved.  He was done driving.  He'd have hopped in the back with Aria, but she was snoozing again, or at least pretending to be.  Nox dropped the power and took a deep breathe.  This was not going to make this trip horrible.

**** Jacinda ****

Jacinda laughed at Nox's little tantrum, shaking her head and rolling her eyes even as she slid over into the driver's seast. This was how it should be anyway. She knew this place, had hunted in this country for decades. Of course she should be driving.  Once they were on their way again, she relaxed. They were heading to the Navajo Reservation, following 40 to Flagstaff, Az and then north on 89 before heading east on 160. The towns had grown over the years but there was still plenty of empty space out there. She'd criss-crossed it and many others over the last 30 years many times. The reports that Nox and Aria were looking at centered on the Four Corners region, which meant very likely they'd be traveling into multiple states on their hunt. Sightings of weird creatures had been reported to Tribal police. So far, they had been scattered in north eastern Arizona, from Shonto and the 98 junction to Betatakin to along the western edge of Skeleton Mesa in Kayenta. The three locations made three points in a triangle they'd need to investigate. The canyons and monuments and formations and bluffs and mesas all made for a beautiful backdrop. But there were also plenty places for things to hide. She was honest, though. It made for a fun hunt. 

The custom of abandoning a home or hogan where someone had died meant that there were many shelters and shade huts for them to stay. As she drove, she talked with Nox, reminiscing about finding a clan of rougs hiding out near Navajo Mountain. They had been intelligent enough to avoid snatching people from the nearest town. Instead they'd take the trail to Lake Powell and find hikers and fisherman and vacationers who'd wandered off. Many visitors came from around the country as well as from other lands and their disappearance was often not noticed for days, weeks or even months. She and another hunter, Shauna, had tracked them to a grouping of hogans near a generic cinderblock home. A large extended family used to live here. Or maybe still did. All changed at once. There were a couple of shadehouses- pinon and cedarwood planks standing at odd heights tied together with wire or twine or occasionally even an old tire to hold them together, the fine red sand piled around the bases.

She and Shauna had crept up to the place after parking a couple miles down in a dry wash. The sage and yucca and twisted scrub provided little cover in the silver glow of the moon-light. Thankfully, they had been inside. Muffled screams had come from a mound of dirt too small to be a hogan. Turned out to be the top of a sweat-lodge that had been dug into the side of a small bluff. They had unsheathed their long knives so that the sound of bullets wouldn't warn the rest of the clan.The air was still and it seemed that every movement of boots on sand or against branches could be heard from a distance. The quiet pressed in on their ears and they had to communicate using handsignals. At least the moonlight meant they could see those.

They had moved from hogan to hogan, spiraling toward the house. Each time, they found one or two rougs that had been watching tv or sleeping and quickly and quietly put them down, whether small as children or large as adults. Thankfully, there had been only a couple adults there, though. The smell of cooking meat and sage and rotting garbage permeated a couple of the places, the cedar and mud walls creating an insulation that let no air in or out.

Finally, satisfied, they crept toward the sweat-lodge and peered through the openeing of the door frame. There was a fire in there as well as a couple of adults, along with a man and a woman tied up and lying on the ground. One of the rougs had been cutting on the woman- she was no longer screaming so they must have hit her- and the man was struggling through his gag. After a moment, they burst in the door and took out the remaining two rougs. The man they knocked out and then untied, then treated the girl's leg where part of it was missing. They also left keys to one of the roug's trucks near the man.

Barely stiffling their excitement after a final once over of the place, they made their way back to the vehicle, the adrenaline and rush of the hunt still coarsing through their bodies. They stayed in the vehicle for a while and soon the windows had steamed up pretty good, enough that the blue-silver moonlight seemed to glow all around the vehicle. It had been a good hunt. Just remembering it got her excited.

It would be nice to go back and see what else would be out there. Aria and Nox should like it. It was a great place to hunt. 

**** Aria ****

Aria was glad she was not having to be actively engaged with Nox and Jacinda, but Nox was getting fustrated, he played it off well, but inside he was upset, until he went blank.  That was bad.  Aria tried to calm him, and he seemed to react, but he stopped the car and got out.  Aria still rested, until Jacinda started regailing her tale about a rougarou hunt up in the same general area.  

Rougarou were interesting creatures, and Aria still felt that they could and should find a cure for the mutation.  They were born human like the rest of them, it wasn't their fault they possessed a rare gene pool.  She'd thought maybe that's what Teyha had been doing, but she hadn't, it was her own needs she supposed, Aria never really did find out about that particular thing, other topics had taken up more priority then.

There was only one recent hunt Aria could even remotely tell Jacinda about, and that was the rougarou hunt.  But even then she hadn't actually gotten the monster that was credited her, Michael had knocked the thing out cold, Aria had only restrained it while they took care of the Bannik, though she had killed that one.  But it wasn't alone, Mr.  White and Rune were instrumental in it as well.  Aria had lost a good sword that day, and had the scars on the palm of her hands to prove it.

They didn't stop much, but they all needed food and to relieve themselves.  It was an okay ride, but by the time they reached their destination Aria was ready for some quality alone time.  They were in the relative middle of no where, it was too dark to track anything the traditional way, and they weren't near any sightings at the moment.  

Jacinda had chosen a wash, it was close to a ridge, it was good, and it was empty.  Aria could feel only the three of them, a smattering of animals, but that was it.  Being out in the middle of no-where was nice every once and a while.  She'd have to do it more often when they got back home.  This definately wasn't home, Aria liked having a bed she could call her own.  She really couldn't understand this life style.  Even the hunters in the CCD all came back to headquarters for a bit of RNR.  They didn't spend their time on the road like this.  It was much more ogranized.  Though Aria did see the draw to the freedom.  It was empowering.

It was like nothing she'd ever dreamt of.  The freedom the open road gave you, yet it was not a stable life.  Your life was spent in the back of a automobile.  There was no home, no family, no friends.  There was loneliness.

Aria could see it in both Nox and Jacinda's eyes, they lived alone, it was them against the world.  Despite the fact that her life had been crap and her caretaker and mentors were not the greatest in the world, she was never really alone.  Someone was always there, even if she didn't like them at he time.  

Jacinda seemed to take charge, it bothered Nox a great deal.  He was a mass of tension and he needed to get away from her, for a while.  Aria only hoped she got that.  It wasn't personal, Aurora did the same thing if they were in the same room too long.  They loved each other, but they grated on each others nerves.  It didn't surprise Aria, but then again, she felt everything from everyone at all times.  That was her life.

It would definitely be a change from the soft cushy beds they had last night, not that Aria had used one much.   They gathered the gear they needed for the night, and set up camp.  Aria sat and just listened.  The emptiness called to her, everything else became noise at the edge of her senses.

**** Nox ****

Chatting was better without the driving.  Jacinda wasn't driving him too crazy, but she was there was still that lingering aggravation.  It lessened as the drive went on, there really was nothing else to do.  Aria slept most of the day away, it was typical, she did listen to some of Jacinda's stories.  

Nox thought maybe Jacinda liked the sound of her own voice at times.  Cocky!

Their camp site was good, and from the look on Aria's face they were alone, for miles on end.  He didn't know how far her radar stretched, but out here it didn't matter, Nox didn't think he'd seen Aria this calm before.  He hadn't been paying that much attention the first time they were in the middle of no where.  They had a lot of time to chat out here on the road.  It was good.  Their friendship had moved forward, and he was certain his decision to stay in Moscow was the right one.  It would do him good for organization, and endless fights.  No roaming, a real home.  A bed to sleep in.  

Nox was going to miss the bed tonight, if Jacinda's hint played out he was really going to miss the bed tonight.

Setting camp was easy, food was even easier, there was no hunting tonight, no fishing, no trapping.  Aria had surprised him when she had caught a rabbit by sneaking up on it.  It was pretty stellar to watch actually, this little girl stalking like a predator.  She moved down wind, the rabbit didn't know what had it before Aria snapped it's neck.  She'd said it was something they used to train her abilities with.  Some ability.  He was pretty sure she didn't mean her Furia/Sentient training, but that empty bubble thing that made her such an awesome fighter.  He'd tried to learn it, but it was still a very foreign concept to him.

Once everyone was settled in and bellies full Nox grabbed his knew leather whip.  He knew he shouldn't use it in front of Jacinda, he knew almost absoutely he'd make a fool of himself.  It felt right though, almost like they knew exactly how it felt in his hand.  It was almost perfect.  

Nox let the whip loose and heard the crack of its leather in the air.  He saw Aria look up with a smile.  He just flexed the whip front and back, it cracked at each end, it was how he'd met Aria, doing the same thing, except there were no walls, and the power only flowed through him, not a weave.  He could almost get used to it.  He missed the fiery glow it usually had though.  

He knew Aria watched him, Jacinda too, but he tried not to think on her.  

**** Jacinda ****

They found a place to stay the night just a few miles west of Tuba City. It was a spot she'd been before, sheltered by some ridges and in a dry wash. They could even make a fire and be undisturbed. 160 was quite a few miles to the south. It was peaceful.

After hours and hours of driving and talking Jacinda was tired. She was ready to just relax and recharge. She thought they were going to have to just eat some of the canned food and jerky they'd brought, but Aria was a good one for the hunt. It surprised Jacinda. She knew how to hunt of course, having been raised by her parents in the wild as well as from her time with Regan and since then. It hadn't been necessary of course. And truth be told, out here, there were slim pickings. The occasional prairie dog or a lizard or three. Rabbits were quick and scarce. The fact that Aria not only found one quickly but was able to get close to it...it made Jacinda think. The girl had skill, a lot of it, especially for one so young.

All Atharim who were reared in it mostly learned from their parents. If your parents hunted or lived off the grid, that's what you learned. But if your parents lived in more traditional locations and didn't do those things, well there wasn't exactly an Atharim school to get you up to speed.

Course she wasn't sure how things were done in the CCD. For some reason, the impression she had of Europe and Asia was that it was densly populated and more strict, less opportunities for a person to wander freely from one end to the other without trouble. She wondered where Aria had learned. IF Nox were telling the truth- and there was no reason for him to lie- then she was highly skilled. Truth was, Jacinda knew few like herself. She was curious.

Nox unfurled a whip and headed off a distance to begin practicing. She watched with some interest while she thought, with the cracks punctuating the silence. He wasn't bad. It was a good weapon to have, though of course she liked a knife. There was something very immediate about it, very personal and private.

Again, her eyes drifted back to Aria. The girl sat there, also watching Nox. Her thoughts were a mystery. But they were very similar. Again, Jacinda thought about her tattoo. The struggle inside, the fear and the guilt. They were feelings she remembered having, though of course that's all they were. Once she'd gotten over them, her effectiveness had doubled. And she could sleep. She watched Aria for a little while.

"How did you join?"

**** Aria ****

Aria watched Nox with the whip, he was doing okay considering the different medium he was used to.  He wasn't flowing as well as he had with the power.  He was utterly empty to her right now Aria hoped he'd not try anything else, she wished he wouldn't grab the power while Jacinda was around.  In a fight he'll want to use it by default, it was his go to weapon now.  It would be a hard temptation to fight.  She might have to talk to him about that too.  They didn't need to alert Jacinda to their abilities.

Jacinda asked her about her joining, Aria smiled.  "I was born into it like Nox and Aurora.  But unlike them I didn't have my family teaching me the way."

Aria turned and looked at Jacinda with a smile.  "My mother was a Furia, she decided she didn't want to be Atharim anymore, but in the process of her flight, she decided to go back, taking her closer to Rome, and the Vatican.  She gave birth to me in Santa Lucia.  My mentor, found her, and took me from her then shot her in the head.  Furia don't leave the Atharim, not alive anyway."

Aria turned to watch Nox and the fluid movements of the whip.  "I was trained to be Atharim, to be a weapon and nothing more.  From the moment I was capable, I was taught how to fight.  My lessons ranged from the very basics of a normal childhood learning to several languages, many fighting styles, an enormous amount of weapons, and all about monsters.  I learned how to kill people, knew how to do it quickly and quietly, what was slow and tortourous.  It's all I've known my entire life."

"I've been training every day of my life to be Furia, to track monsters, to kill them.  There was nothing else."

**** Jacinda ****

She listened to Aria and felt a brief stab at the word Furia. Like Rune. She had mixed feelings about these people with abilities. It sounded a little too other-worldly. They were clearly different than other normal people. Once you accept them, what then? Wolfkin? What about the reborn gods? What if you had a god that was an Atharim? Did that lessen the danger they posed?

Still....Furia were unique. Their abilities did not give them extra-strength. It did not give them the power to destroy the world. They did not infect others like Chupes did. They were not murderous cannibals like the rougs. They didn't feed like Dreyken, nor were they deadly like Oni. They didn't possess like Wefuke. They were people who could sense violence. That was it. 

Jacinda herself had good instincts in that regard. The way a person walked, carried themselves, the way they registered the world, absorbed it through their eyes and ears, all indicated whether they were alert or not, whether they expected danger. Dangerous people expected danger. It was as near a self-evident truth as she could imagine. In fact, if she had to put a finger on it, it had been the reason she had noticed Nox and primarily Aria back at the Casino.

She wouldn't call that Furia abilities. Just instinct. So maybe that's what Furia were? Those people with a natural instinct for picking up on cues in body language and pheremones had a slight advantage...and the trait gets passed on. In her world, to her perspective, that made sense. She knew that if she had chosen to have a child, all those traits and skills that had let her survive the years of hunting and fights that she had gone through would get passed on. She had earned it.

The storm in her mind passed. She could accept Aria as Furia, could trust her as a fellow hunter. She'd be alert, of course. But she was always alert. Even now, sitting with Aria and watching Nox practice, she was aware of her surroundings, of the...chaos pattern of this place. And if there were a danger- if someone were sneaking up on them or there was some other danger- she would sense it.

She relaxed. "A hell of a story. Mine was similar. At least the being trained in it from a young age. My parents taught me living off the grid, in the wild. And Regan Cross taught me the hunt, weaponry, fighting, everything else really. The rest of my life has been honing that skill. And living for the hunt." She smiled at Aria. "I'm looking forward to seeing you in action."

The fire continued to crackle and pop, the smoke in the air drifting up, the flicker of orange-red light around the camp. And a distance away, Nox's own cracks of his whip punctuated the silence.

****  Nox *****

Nox could tell that the women folk were talking.  He could feel their eyes on him.  But it didn't matter, he was loving the feel of the leather in his hand, the snap of the leather as it reached is't length.  It wasn't a weapon to spar with, but it was a good weapon.  It would do.  Now if he could only keep in mind that the power couldn't be used.  That was going to be a trial, he was going to look like a fool, he knew it.

It wasn't tireing, but he was feeling his arms and back.  Last night had done a number on him, he definitely didn't want a repeat performance.  And for him, that was saying a lot.  Aurora would laugh at him, turning down a romp in the hay.

But Jacinda was wrapped up and resting, Aria was staring out in the wilderness lost in thought.  She looked peaceful, which was a rarety.  Nox sat down next to her.  It was nice just to be quiet for a while.  

A yawn peirced Nox's silence and he went off to find his gear and take a rest.  He'd releive Aria of her night time watch, other wise she'd be up all night. 

Sleep came quickly.

**** Aria ****

Both Nox and Jacinda drifted off to sleep.  It was almost dead quiet.  Even in the midddle of no where before with Nox, there was always someone lingering at the edges, another camper something, at this very moment she was utterly alone.  They slept, their dream selves were easy to block out.  Aria stayed up, just listening to the silence, watching the stars, it was beautiful out here.  

Nox woke up, "Aria you need to sleep I can keep watch."

Aria shook her head. "I'm good Nox.  You sleep.  It's quiet, really I'm good."  He didn't fight her too much on the topic, he lazily went back to his sleeping bag and drifted back into nothingness.

She couldn't do this forever, but it was a wonderful feeling.  Aria knew she'd have to find a place like that in the CCD, someplace to go where there was no one on her radar except those with her.  The paradise it would be for her.

The sun came up over the horizon and it was amazing.  Aria could have taken a snap shot with her wallet, but she committed it to memory, maybe she'd learn to paint one day.  

Aria started the fire going a bit more, to heat some water and rewarm some more food before the others woke.  Her peacefulness was about to go away, but soon the hunt would start and that brought another peace - that of the dying breath of a monster leaving this world.

Nox's alarm went of as per its normal schedule, he roused with a stretch and a concerned look.  "You been up all night."

Aria smiled.  "I'm okay, Nox.  I promise.  Best night, in almost forever.  Coffee will be ready soon, it's in the fire."

**** Jacinda ****

Jacina woke to the early light of dawn. The fire had died down to embers but it wasn't too cold and she was in her bag anyway. She extended her sense of hearing and smell and sampled the morning, allowed its feel and mood to wash over her, callibrating her for the day.

Immediately she was aware of the fact that Aria was awake, though not moving yet. She was watching the sky pink. Nox was still his own bag. Jacinda had woken regularly througout the night- truth was, she never really slept fully. You could die that way. The girl had never passed on the watch. Jacinda had kept awake for an hour or two, though she didnt anymore or say anything to indicate she was awake. The crackle of the fire was the only sound and she had fallen into the alert meditative state she used when she was on watch, alert to sensing any order imposing itself on the chaos of nature. A few small creatures had drifted by, curious and fearful of the fire. Then she'd go back to sleep, though still alert. It wasn't that she didn't trust Aria to do a good job. It was that she was used to doing it herself. It had been that way for a long time- most of her life really, after Regan had been killed. You had to sleep and keep watch at the same time. So she'd learned how to do it from her bag. She wasn't going to stop now, not after almost 30 years. Partners or no, keeping safe was her responsibility.

Aria seemed the same, at least with the watch. Probably everything else too. She'd sleep in the car, but Jacinda'd bet that she was only ever half asleep. A living weapon to kill the dark. Jacinda had been formed by her life, her experiences, every kill, every hunt and trail and victory, her skills honed to razor sharpness. Aria was a product of the same thing, though her sharpening had been deliberate by her mentors. Idly, Jacinda wondered which of them had the better skill. Which was the better? Learning from hard-won experience or from calculated training? Even if they had been the same age, she'd wager it was experience. The added years made that a sure thing in her mind. Failure in training would be punished, even harshly, but still just punishment. Failure in experience meant death or maiming or serious injury. There were no second chances in the real world. Not that Aria didn't live and work in the real world. She'd not take that from her. But still.

In any case, it didn't matter. They were on the same team. Nox awoke and spoke to Aria. Jacinda heard the affection in their voices, the camraderie. She missed that. These two had worked together enough to anticipate, to have a shorthand for speaking to and dealing with each other. It had been a while since she had a partner or partners where that level of trust could be developed. Not since Tommy and Dax. They'd worked well together. Very well. But Dax had been killed and Tommy took it hard. He never got over it. He'd kind of drifted away after that, leaving Jacinda alone. It had hurt. She'd not deny that. But that was life. Experience again.

Jacinda got up to pee and then get some coffee. She didn't say much. That was typical for the mornings for her. After getting some food in them, they packed up and headed back down the wash to 160 and then east. Jacinda drove, listening to Aria's reading aloud of the police reports. The tribal police had received reports from Shonto and Tsegi Canyon and even as far as the western side of Skeleton Mesa of strange creatures seen in the distance, of sheep missing or noises. The area had grown up over the last 20 years, what with all the movement inland after the distasters of the 2020's. What used to be a lot of empty space between Kayanta and the 98 junction was now a lot of housing butting up against Black Mesa. The train tracks there that had been used for shipping coal to the power plant in Page were now used for commercial and commuter traffic, as Page had turned into a thriving city. Having a dam and a powerplant there with ready access to natural reserves made it a pretty natural place for that kind of thing. The upside was that there were a lot of people from Kayenta all the way to Red Mesa, far more than the 5000 it used to be. 

There were reports of missing hikers, BML workers, sheepherders and missionaries. Not enough to cause the FBI to investigate. People turned up and they had been lost or it had been a breakdown. But still, there were enough missing that the Atharim intelligence had noticed it and, coupled with the reports of prowling creatures, had flagged it as a possible den of...something. Chupes maybe.

They drove the hour and then turned off onto 98 to go to Shonto and begin there. There were back roads that would take them into Tsegi Canyon to the Anasazi cliff dwelling ruins at Betatakin National Monument and from there to Skeleton Mesa. Despite the larger population, a lot of those roads would be out of the way and unknown. Jacinda had a hunch on where they might find their quarry, but you always started at the beginning and proceeded in an orderly fashion. Making assumptions usually led to mistakes. And more importantly, being able to scout out the area, circling in slowly, allowed her to get a feel for how things were, how they lay, what was normal and what wasn't. It created an impression for her that then let her see when something was off that much more clearly.

They got to the Trading Post at Shonto and got out to use the facilites, purchase some food and water, and talk to the the people. They could have used the gas station or grocery store or shopping center, but they wanted to be where they'd get the best information. Between the jeep and their hard look, they looked like off-roaders. It was a good cover. The locals wouldn't look at them twice, viewed them as a necessary and wanted them as a source of revenue, and so would give them valuable information.

The Najavo lady at the stand handed them each a paper towel with a thick oily piece of frybread in it. Next to the stack of napkins was a plastic bottle of honey, which Jacinda drizzled all over the bread before taking a bite. "So good," she said to the woman between bites and wiping her mouth, taking a deep breath. "I love coming out here. It's so beautiful here." She'd let her voice become soft and relaxed, unhurried. She didn't hold the woman's eyes- it was considered rude- and she'd point to her surroundings by gesturing with her neck and sticking her lips out, as if using her hand to point and encompass the area. Subconsciously, the woman relaxed at her miroring her way of speaking and acting. The wind's breeze drowned out the other noises of other people and cars. After a few minutes of chewing and silence, she gestured with her head. "We wanted to head into Tsegi Canyon on one of the back roads. Do you know where a good one is?"

The woman was quiet and looked at them for a moment and then said, "There are a couple." She pointed with her lips up to the road ahead. "See the cattle guard over there? Head down that one and stay to the right. You'll come to a fork at a rock with a big juniper. Stay to the right and follow it. You'll pass a sheep camp on your left and then some fields. Keep going and you'll get into Tsegi Canyon."

"That your family's camp?"

"Oah-'" she said, the Najavo version of 'yes'. "We don't use it, though. The sheep are up north now at the other camp." She looked away at Jacinda's questioning look. Eye contact wasn't big here but there was a reason. A southern sheep camp near the canyon meant more water. The fields confirmed that. Further north it was drier. They were staying away from the southern camp for a reason.

"Any bears or coyote or wolves out there that we should be worried about?" The question was leading. Though the place was called Shonto- "bear"- they hadn't seen bears out here in decades. As a tourist, of course, they shouldn't know that. And truth was, the number of coyotes and wolves had also dropped a lot as the population had increased.

The woman looked at Jacinda and then at Aria and Nox. "There been a few muh-i"- coyotes- "but no muh-i-tso."- wolves. She seemed to use the Najavo words as a test for Jacinda. Did she really belong out here? At Jacinda's nod, she seemed to relax. "But there was a bear I think. My uncle saw one at the sheep camp." She looked at Jacinda. "Be careful out there. We lost some sheep. It wasn't a coyote or wolf I don't think. At least that's what my Chei"- Grandfather- "said." Her face softened. "If you want to see Betatakin, go back to 160 and head up the turn to the National Monument. It's safer."

Jacinda smiled at her. "Eh-yeh-heh"- Thank you- "But my friends want to see the canyon from this side." She gestured to Nox. "He has a gun. We can scare anything off if we need to."

The woman looked at her for another few minutes. Things out here were quiet and people moved and responded slowly. They weren't slow, of course. But they liked to think and take everything in before responding. "Well, it's up to you. Be careful."

Jacinda smiled at her. "Eh-yeh-heh. Can we get some more frybread to go? And a bottle of honey?" The woman smiled and wrapped up some more bread and the bottle and then took her money.

They got back into the jeep and Jacinda waved at the woman before driving leisurely back up the road to the cattle guard that marked the turn off the highway.

It was at least a start.

**** Nox ****

Aria hadn't slept at all, what he'd gathered from it was she was perfectly content enjoying the near emptiness of things.  Nox wondered what Jacinda thought of her staying up like that.  Nox knew Aria would cat nap on the drive, but not likely, he'd seen her stay up past 24 hours before, hunting or no, he wouldn't give up his abilities for hers.  There was no way he'd want to feel what everyone felt all the time.  Yeah it would come in handy, but it had to be stressful.  He didn't evny her that.

Jacinda as per their start yesterday had taken over.  It felt like she was treating them like kids, like they hadn't been doing this their whole lives, this was their mission, not hers, they weren't tagging along.  She was grating his nerves, good lay or no.  

But Aria let her, and she seemed fine with it.  Even a little admiration he'd thought.  He should have been more awed by her, he knew that.  But Nox was tired of being treated like a child.  It was the big reason he and Aurora didn't get along on the hunt.  They worked differently.  

However, Jacinda taking the lead was probably good, it reminded him to keep his skills in check.  Aria had a cover for hers, but him, there was nothing he could really do.  He prayed, and he never prayed, that they didn't come into a situation where he had to use his power or die.  He wouldn't hesitate to save his skin from a monster with the power.  He'd have to kill Jacinda too, but that was a matter for another day.

The town they stopped in was not used to outsiders that was for sure, Nox was more than happy to let Jacinda do the leg work.  It was what Aurora did, and Aria was napping.  At least pretending to anyway.  He doubted she was actually sleeping.

Once they got back in the Jeep with and the frybread smelled way too good.  He'd enjoyed the peice he'd had earlier while listening to the woman, now his stomach was rumbling again.   But they moved on down towards the south.  The scenarey was pretty nice, nothing he'd not seen before, but it had been a while since he'd been in Arizona, and he was pretty sure he'd not been on this particular reservation, however the years were a blur of memories.  He couldn't make out specifics.  He'd probably never get all of them back in proper working order, but he knew enough to survive and the rest was instinct.

They got out of the Jeep when Jacinda stopped, the rest of the way was probably better on foot.  Aria had perked up a bit as they drew near.  She was watching out the window, he knew she felt something.  Nox smiled.  [color=#0072bb]"We should probably start at the last known sighting.  Hopefully we can track it back to its home."[/color]

**** Aria ****

Aria napped, a little, rested was more the word for it.  It was peaceful and Aria was reluctant to leave, but with the sun came the possiblity of a monster hunt.  Jacinda continued in the leadership role.  It annoyed Nox, Aria could feel it.   When it was just the two of them, he was calm and centered and very relaxed, but with Jacinda, he felt like he did with Aurora - a mass of anxiety and annoyance.  Jacinda was a good leader, a bit bossy, but she knew what she was doing, and she seemed to know the area well enough.  Nox let her lead, without a fight he'd have made with his sister.  That made Aria proud of that little feat.

As the GPS told them they were nearing the site, Aria extended her senses to their limit.  The closer they got, Aria'd have thought the world grew thicker with the violence of the area.

One of the reports said the area had been sheep farmers and a dozen or more sheep had been killed.  Another reported a shepherd had been ripped apart.  The boy had been found days later scavanged by every beast that could, and very little information beyond that was in the report.  A couple of campers had been found ripped apart miles away from the boy.  The distance between all the camps had been pretty far, whatever it was could cover a lot of distance with ease.  A few bears had been reported.  Bears, in the desert, Aria thought that was weird.  Aria wondered if there was local lore on bears.  It seemed an odd place for a bear.  Aria could only think of one monster that could be described as a bear for its hulking size and strength, and that was an Oni.  She'd faced a few of them.  With out Nox's power she wasn't looking forward to facing one again.  

Nox was spoiling her with the use of his power, she hadn't ever thought she'd have relied on someone, much less a godling.  But Nox was good, he was Atharim.  Aria didn't care what the Regus thought of godlings, Nox was good people, as was Aurora and most of the other godlings she'd met over time.

They got to the last scene.  The two campers, the scene was pretty much cleaned up.  The forensic teams and all that had made use of all the details, Aria wondered what the Tribal police had on it, they were good trackers.  The campers had died violently.  They'd been ripped to peices, and only a few peices taken out of them, the kill wasn't meant for food.

Aria focused on the scene and on the violence, Nox stood around doing his thing, which meant nothing.  He knew Aria would do a better job tracking, he'd come to trust her ability, as she trusted his.  She smiled at him and nodded in the direction the satisfaction and hunger lead away.  Or to, either didn't matter, it was still the path it had taken at one point in time.  Aria looked to Jacinda to see what she'd come up with.  [color=lightgreen]"It went this way."[/color]

**** Jacinda ****
