**** Nox ****

Alex had wanted to meet him, but he hadn't wanted to stick around.  He opted to grab a cup of coffee and walk around the block a few times after introductions.  He had no interest in be analyzed by Aria's doctor sister.  What their relationship was was none of her business outside of what Aria shared.  He'd not go see his own sisters therapist if she had one.  Doctors like that were quacks, he understood that Alex was like Aria to a degree, he also didn't like that, he didn't mind Aria in his head, but that had taken getting used to anyway.

Afterwards their hunt landed short when they found squatters in the area they'd planned on cleansing.  Which meant the monsters weren't there.  And Aurora would now have to correct their maps and mark the map as a place to check to to make sure no one had died.  No one had, which was sad, but good.

They'd called their hunt early, and Aria went to see Lucas, and Nox decided he'd talk with Aurora.  It would go down one of two ways.  'No way, you aren't going.'  or 'I'm not going back there.  You can go.'

He was going either way, with or without Aurora.  He only hoped Aria could talk Lucas into it.  Nox didn't fancy a trip on a plane by himself, or to ride around the country alone.  It wasn't as much fun, and with Aria there, it would at least be adventerous, and it was more like a tour.  If she didn't go, he'd probably just go get the Jeep and come back.  It was sad thinking about it, the things he'd miss from home.  But the endless monsters, the ease of finding them, it was so much less work here than in the States.  Which meant more hunting and Aurora was clearly happy in the books.  Aria said she'd take her to the Vatican one day, but if they did that Nox didn't think his sister would leave.

Their apartment was shared, how they managed to live together in one place was amazing, they always fought before.  Two bathrooms, their own rooms, and the fact that Nox kept very strange hours to keep up with Aria meant he wasn't home much.  Aurora wasn't home much either, she spent a good deal of her time at HQ reading and researching and making their personal database better.  It was a create adventure for her, going through all that history.  She really was a scholar and not a hunter.  It was good.  It really was.

Aurora was in the kitchen when he walked in, she smiled a bit surprised at his arrival, "I thought you and Aria were out hunting."

Nox laughed.  "Cut short, squaters in the quadrant we were combing, no monsters, no dead.  Not much to do.  Besides we needed to have a few discussions with our loved ones."  He grinned at his sister.  "I'm gonna head back home for a while.  Get our gear, my Jeep, and show Aria around."

Aurora raised an eyebrown, Nox laughed, "She's talking to Lucas.  I think she'll get him to see the light.  But you never know, he might have too much pull."

Aurora poured Nox a glass of wine and set it down.  "I'm sure she'll do her best.  Though she doesn't fly you know that right?"

Nox nodded as he took a sip.  "Yeah, and I'm not a fan of it myself.  But we'll deal with it then.  You want to go?"

Aurora laughed.  "Ain't no way.  You can go back to that life, I like this one.  I don't want to live out of the back of your Jeep, never sleeping in a bed except maybe once or twice a month, always hunting our next gig.  No way Nox.  Not one.  And I'm not getting on a plane with you again."  Aurora stuck her tongue out at him and he laughed.

Nox grinned.  "Not quite what I expected, but still the same answer.  You didn't want to go.  You sure?"  He poked his sister in the arm as she set a plate down in front of him. 

"You might as well eat with me since you are here." 

Nox nodded.  "If you inisist dear sister of mine."  There was only one thing left to do and that was wait for Aria to get back to him.

Aria sent him a text, "He's not particularly thrilled, but he didn't tell me to stay either.  Let me know the details.  Gonna spend the rest of the time with him until we leave."

Nox laughed.  "I suppose that it could have gone worse."  

He looked to his sister with bright pleading eyes.  "Can you do me a favor?"

Aurora laughed.  "You want me to book your flight for the two of you and make other arrangements State side?"

Nox nodded.  "Pretty please?  I'll owe you big time."

"You are right you will.  I'll do it for Aria, not for you."  Aurora punched him in the arm. "I'll let ya both know the details.  Now eat."

**** Lucas ****

Lucas had called Nox and told him he was coming over. Nox didn't seem particularly enthused but there was not much he could do it about it how was there. Lucas wasn't asking for permission, after all. Nox had created a situation that was very dangerous and didn't seem to realize it. Perhaps he didn't know. But Lucas really wasn't in a charitable mood. Aria was his concern, not sparing Nox's feelings.

He knocked on the door and waited for Nox to open. When he did, Lucas didn't bother waiting. He walked in and sat down on his couch. Nox stood by the door for a moment. "Why don't you come in," he said sarcastically. Lucas wasn't in the mood.

Nox came over to sit down after a moment. Lucas didn't waste time. "The danger you have put her in?"

"You mean more danger than what she faces everyday?"  Nox sounded confused.

Lucas looked at him flatly. "You're not an idiot Nox. You know about Aria's abilities. You know what growing up like that has done to her." His exasperation grew as the fact that Nox knew quite well about Aria's past, her struggles. His voice grew vehement. "You *know* that she fights with her hungers, with darkness EVERY time she goes hunting. I accept that is part of her life, her work." He looked down for a moment, calming himself. "She comes by or calls me after every hunt. She calms down. She pulls back from the edge. What do you think is going to happen while spending a month with you in the States?"

Nox nodded.  "The same thing that happens when she's done with a hunt, call you.  It's not like phones don't exist in the States."  He sighed.  "I know to take care of her.  I know I have to be careful.  But you are right, I didn't think about it when I asked her.  I was being selfish.  I didn't want to go alone.  But I know Aria too.  She'll call you.  I'll make sure of it."

Lucas rolled his eyes and sighed. He was tired. "You don't know what it's like Nox. You help her for a moment- and I appreciate that, I do!- but you don't know. A phone call tides her over for a little while. But after a few days I have to see her. I don't what exactly it is about me, but our being together reset her or something. All that dark leeches away. I don't know if you believe in God but I do. And I know my purpose is to be an anchor for her, to be her place of calm." He knew it sounded ridiculous. He really didn't care. His fears for Aria were many and he kept them in check because he felt like his being there for her made a difference, that *he* mattered to her. He wanted her to be happy. Truth was he hoped she'd find a place in herself where she didn't need him to be at peace. It would be the only way she could truly be free. He wanted her to be free because then she would never have to depend on anyone for happiness. She should have that whether he was there in her life or not. 

The thought made him stop, made him pause. He was acting like he owned Aria, like without him she couldn't do it at all. He wanted her to be able to. He did. He wanted to be able to trust her. He put his head down in his hands and sighed, overwhelmed by the situation. "Ahh man, I know how this sounds." He shook his head. "But she is child in so many ways." He looked up at Nox pleadingly. "I want her to be able to be happy on her own. She shouldn't have to need or depend on me for it." He sighed and shook his head slowly. "I am scared Nox. I am scared for her. I hope she can do this." Maybe this was necessary. Like weaning a child or something. "Please Nox. Watch over her. Help her. Protect her. Please?"

**** Nox ****

Lucas had called, he wanted to come over.  Just what he wanted, his partner's boyfriend coming over for a chat.  Probably over the whole asking her to go with him.  He wasn't looking forward to it.

Lucas knocked and when he answered it Lucas pretty much just came right in and sat down.  Nox couldn't help but make a quip.  It was him afterall.

He started and Nox really hadn't thought about it.  Not really.  Not about what Aria would do after each hunt.  And it wouldn't be easy, it was alot of traveling, alot of boring mostly.  But he hadn't told that to Aria.  It was part the freedom it offered.  

Lucas said he didn't know, that he was only there for a moment.  It was never a moment.  It was the whole fight, the before, the after, and then it was in their down time.  Lucas didn't know a lot about Aria, and what she had done, what she wanted to do when the darkness engulfed her.  The person she was in the fight.  He glimpsed it, he put her back together, and Nox didn't envy it one bit.  Nox knew what she went through first hand, he'd felt it.  He'd made the mistake only once, but he'd felt it, felt the pain she wanted to make things suffer with.  It had been concern that made him touch her, the cut looked bad, but it was the fight that made it worse.  

He agreed that Aria was a child in many ways, he thought of her as a little sister, Aurora was older by moments but she was more mature, more adult than he was, but Aria, she was older but so much younger.  He was scared too.  Now that Lucas brought it up.  What if she went too far?  Things got bad?  Nox could take only so much, he knew his limits, he knew if Aria wanted to hurt him she could.  But really, she needed the chance to do this, to be a human being without the restrictions of the institution she grew up in.  To be normal for once.

Nox grinned.  "You don't need to ask me to do any of that, it's something I do because I want to.  She's family, Lucas.  More than you'll ever know.  And you, dude, are her family, even if she never sees it.  I will do anything and everything to protect her, from monster and herself.  I'll die trying, it'll be my last breath, I promise you that."

****

Lucas looked at Nox. The man was making him a promise and he meant it. Lucas was still scared- scared of what Aria had done, what she was capable of, what she could become. He feared for her. But he had to let her alone. He had to let her do this. It wasn't his place to stand in her way.

"I appreciate that Nox. I trust you." He shook his head. As much as he didn't want this to happen, perhaps it was for the best. Aria had to stand on her own. With Lucas physically there, that wouldn't happen. Nox would protect her, he knew, as best he could he would. But ultimately, this was up to Aria.

He looked into Nox's eye and the dropped it. He wasn't happy. But it wasn't in his control. It had to happen. He'd just wished there had been more time. Time was something they had little of. "Well, I guess I better go. Sorry about blowing up at you. I just...it's my job to protect her. And I'm afraid she's not ready." Now that he said it, he knew it. He was afraid that she wasn't ready yet. But that was life. What were you ever ready for? It was all about how you faced the challenge when it came. You couldn't know it was coming. You could plan, you could try. But ultimately, you never really knew until it was there.

This was Aria's time. All he could do was hope. And believe in her. Tell her that he believed in her. 

After a few more words, he left. They didn't have a lot of time left. He was going to spend it with her.
