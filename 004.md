**** Nox ****

Alex had wanted to meet him, but he hadn't wanted to stick around.  He opted to grab a cup of coffee and walk around the block a few times after introductions.  He had no interest in be analyzed by Aria's doctor sister.  What their relationsship was was none of her business outside of what Aria shared.  He'd not go see his own sisters therapist if she had one.  Doctors like that were quacks, he understood that Alex was like Aria to a degree, he also didn't like that, he didn't mind Aria in his head, but that had taken getting used to anyway.

Afterwards their hunt landed short when they found squatters in the area they'd planned on cleansing.  Which meant the monsters weren't there.  And Aurora would now have to correct their maps and mark the map as a place to check to to make sure no one had died.  No one had, which was sad, but good.

They'd called their hunt early, and Aria went to see Lucas, and Nox decided he'd talk with Aurora.  It would go down one of two ways.  'No way, you aren't going.'  or 'I'm not going back there.  You can go.'

He was going either way, with or without Aurora.  He only hoped Aria could talk Lucas into it.  Nox didn't fancy a trip on a plane by himself, or to ride around the country alone.  It wasn't as much fun, and with Aria there, it would at least be adverterous, and it was more like a tour.  If she didn't go, he'd probably just go get the Jeep and come back.  It was sad thinking about it, the things he'd miss from home.  But the endless monsters, the ease of finding them, it was so much less work here than in the States.  Which meant more hunting and Aurora was clearly happy in the books.  Aria said she'd take her to the Vatican one day, but if they did that Nox didn't think his sister would leave.

Their apartment was shared, how they managed to live together in one place was amazing, they always fought before.  Two bathrooms, their own rooms, and the fact that Nox kept very strange hours to keep up with Aria meant he wasn't home much.  Aurora wasn't home much either, she spent a good deal of her time at HQ reading and researching and making their personal database better.  It was a create adventure for her, going through all that history.  She really was a scholar and not a hunter.  It was good.  It really was.

Aurora was in the kitchen when he walked in, she smiled a bit surprised at his arrival, "I thought you and Aria were out hunting."

Nox laughed.  "Cut short, squaters in the quadrant we were combing, no monsters, no dead.  Not much to do.  Besides we needed to have a few discussions with our loved ones."  He grinned at his sister.  "I'm gonna head back home for a while.  Get our gear, my Jeep, and show Aria around."

Aurora raised an eyebrown, Nox laughed, "She's talking to Lucas.  I think she'll get him to see the light.  But you never know, he might have too much pull."

Aurora poured Nox a glass of wine and set it down.  "I'm sure she'll do her best.  Though she doesn't fly you know that right?"

Nox nodded as he took a sip.  "Yeah, and I'm not a fan of it myself.  But we'll deal with it then.  You want to go?"

Aurora laughed.  "Ain't no way.  You can go back to that life, I like this one.  I don't want to live out of the back of your Jeep, never sleeping in a bed except maybe once or twice a month, always hunting our next gig.  No way Nox.  Not one."

Nox grinned.  "Not quite what I expected, but still the same answer.  You didn't want to go.  You sure?"  He poked his sister in the arm as she set a plate down in front of him. 

"You might as well eat with me since you are here." 

Nox nodded.  "If you inisist dear sister of mine."  There was only one thing left to do and that was wait for Aria to get back to him.
