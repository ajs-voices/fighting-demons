**** Nox ****

The hunt had gone well.  They'd gone their separate ways, it was usual for that. Aria typically went home to call Lucas after a hunt, finish getting her head on straight.  Nox he had other things he wanted to do, but he stopped at a pub and sat down at bar and drank a beer alone.  He could have gone out, found a girl and brought her home, had some fun and sent her packing.  Today he just wanted to drink alone.  

It was the anniversary of his mother's death.  Hunting had helped, Aria knew it and it was the reason they'd gone out in the first place, though she never said so much.  Kept his mind from the horrors he had witnessed.  A man left the old school news paper on the bar.  He didn't look old enough to have one as a kid, but his Dad, he had, and he had picked it up from him.  Maybe it was a similar way for the man who'd left it.

Nox picked up the paper and moved to a booth, against the wall, was easier to relax and read it.  The CCD spoke english, but their style of paper was different.    It was funny the man had been reading the New York Times.  Their front page news was typical.  But it wasn't the front page Nox wanted.  He looked for the bizarre artcles in the back.  Nothing really stood out to him.

Nox remembered all the good times at home.  He missed home, he missed his car.  He could bring it back?  One last nostalgia tour, he could show Aria around his stomping grounds.  That could be fun.  She lived such a sheltered life, getting her out of here, on the road, where he had grown up.  It could be fun.  

But he'd have to talk to her about it.  Talk to Aurora, and no doubt Aria would have to talk with Lucas.  Girl claimed he was just a friend, but it was so very much more and it was obvious they cared a great deal for each other.  He was envious, and then not.  Aria worried about him, and he knew Lucas worried about her.  Hunting was dangerous.  Lucas was going to lose Aria at some point, and there wasn't going to be much he could do about it, except make Aria stop and that was going to be one sure way to lose her.  Nox was so very glad he wasn't in that committed relationship.  He needed Aria, and she him, but there were no complications, they understood the game, understood the risks and the nature of their jobs.  And they both knew it was no one's fault in the end.

Nox finished his beer.  He got up out of the booth and headed for the door, dropping the paper on the bar for the next curious person to pick up.  It wasn't his afterall.

Nox hadn't had a chance to talk to Aria about going state-side.  It had been a busy couple of days, between follow up doctor appointments and his typical day on the job, he'd not actually seen Aria.  More her fault than his, he was pretty much like a clock, followed the same pattern almost everyday.  8am rise, head to Gracies for a quick workout, breakfast and so on, almost always the same every day.  And that included hunting with Aria at night.  She kept strange hours.  He was often up well past 2am hunting.  Which was all good.  Some days she was on day light hours.

Nox understood the reasons, but still it made her life a mess.  His was not.  He had to follow the pattern or he'd go so off tangent he might not ever find his way back, that was what happened with his dad.  He lost his focus, and went on a tangent, he never came back from it.

But today he was taking Aria to see Alex.  She usually went alone, but they were going to hit the tunnels afterwards and see if anything caught their fancy.  He could talk to her when he picked her up.  He'd have to persuade her to actually ride the metro, she could walk the whole city, she probably had.  

**** Aria ****

A knock on her door had to be Nox, she called out "Come in, it's unlocked."  Aria finished strapping on her sword and smiled at Nox as he opened te door.  "All set."

He laughed.  "Perfect timing I see."

Aria smiled as she pulled on her trench coat.  And they left down the back stairs and not through the shop.   Alex was interested in meeting Nox, this would be the first time they'd actually sat down together.  And then they'd hit the tunnels and do some more scouting.

Nox insisted they take the metro.  He didn't mind the walking, but she knew that he didn't want to walk all the way to the coffee shop she and Alex met at.  Aria also got the feeling he wanted to be able to talk.Nox

And sure enough, once they got on the train, Nox started.  "I had a thought."

Aria smiled, she knew exactly what Aurora would say.  'Thinking is dangerous, Nox, you better stop that.'  And from the goofy grin on his face, Nox knew that was what she was thinking.

"Yeah I know," he chimed in, "Aurora has her thoughts on me thinking.  But I need to get my Jeep and bring it here.  I miss her, and having a car would be good, even if we stay here in Moscow."

Aria was confused and wondered what that had to do with her.   "And?"

Nox laughed nervously.  "Come with me.  I'll show you around the States, kick around a few places before coming back here.  I like it here, but I miss home too."  He smiled proudly, "Let me show you my home."

He didn't want to go alone, Aria smiled.  "Why not go with Aurora?  I'm sure she misses it too."  

Nox frowned.  "We get along well enough, but with you around it's always better.  Please?"

Nox pleaded with her.  Aria wasn't exactly sure about the whole thing, it would require a flight or passage by boat, and neither were really her cup of tea.  "I don't think I can get there safely."

Nox wrapped his arm around her.  "I'll help you, you help me.  Flying isn't exactly top priority on my list either.  We'll get each other through it."

Aria sighed, she still wasn't sure, but it would be good to get away from here for a while, and seeing America was something she'd never thought she'd do.  "I need to talk with Lucas, make sure he's okay with me going anywhere with you."

Nox laughed.  "You do that.  I'll ask Aurora if she wants to go.  Tell Lucas he's welcome to come, but I know that it limits your hunting if he tags along.  So your call, Aria."
