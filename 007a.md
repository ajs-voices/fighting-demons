**** Aria ****
Aria watched Nox take Jacinda away, he could be a nice guy when he wanted to be.  Though that wasn't him being nice for the sake of being nice, that was being nice for the sake of getting laid.  

A few hours to kill, calling Lucas sounded like a good thing.  She'd not talked to him much since they started on the road again.  She called when she could, but reception  wasn't always great in the middle of the mountains.

Aria left the bar and paid their bill, which Nox kindly forgot to do.  It wasn't the first nor the last time.  And he had paid for the room, it wasn't that bad she supposed.

Aria found a nice quiet corner in one of the lounges in the casino, away from as many people as possible.  She sat in a corner recliner and curled up as she dialed the long distance number that would get her to Lucas.  As the other end started to ring, Aria realized it was 2am in Moscow.  Crap! Too late now he would already be awakened.  

**** Lucas ****

Lucas was dead to the world. A busy day and a hard workout will do that to you. He didn't even dream. When his wallet went off, he had a hard time figuring out what the noise was, where it was coming from, or what it meant. He hit the wallet a few times somehow thinking it would stop. When finally he woke enough that his brain engaged, he swiped the phone and answered in a muffled voice. "Hello?"

Whether he fell back asleep or whether the other person just took a long time answering, when he finally heard the response he again had to wake himself up and figure out what was going on.

**** Aria ****

Aria felt horrible.  "Hey Lucas.  It's Aria.  I'm so sorry."  Aria felt even worse when she had to repeat herself.

A groggy voice came on the line. "Hi Aria." A sigh. "How are you?"

Aria smiled, she loved hearing his voice.  "I'm good, Nox is entertaining a girl.  I'm avoiding the room he got.  Some fancy thing he'd been saving for.  At least he'll get his moneies worth tonight I guess."

Aria paused, he was sleepy, he didn't need to talk to her, she was for once just calling to call.  It didn't happen often.  "I'm sorry I called.  I forget where I'm at and the time difference.  

His voice was relaxed, almost asleep. "It's ok. I like hearing your voice." A yawn. "I can talk."

He always knew what to say to make her smile.  She missed Lucas.  It was only a couple months she'd be away.  Experiences and all the things she didn't get growing up, out on her own, relatively speaking, Nox was still there, but he was a good friend, most of the time.

They chatted for a while about his day, Aria told him about Jacinda, not so much in depth but that they'd met a hunter, and that's who was sharing Nox's bed tonight.

"I'm gonna head up to my room.  Nox has had enough time to migrate to his room."  Aria wanted to lie down in bed, she was tired and that's where Lucas was, at least she could pretend he was there with her.

Once Aria got to their room she could tell Nox and Jacinda weren't in the main room, she opened the door quietly and went to her room.  She took a deep breathe and called her center.  They were still hot and heavy into their night.  

Closing the door to her room Aria spied the tub.  She hated that Nox knew things, but he kept the secrets to himself even the ones Lucas didn't know yet.  Aria smiled, she hadn't had a proper soak since she'd gotten to the US.  "Bath or Bed?  Both so tempting."

His voice seemed to perk up a bit. "What? Oh. Bath. That way your naked and I can picture you naked." Another yawn. "Course...I guess you can be naked in bed too. I'll just picture you that way no matter what." He sighed again. "Good dreams." Another yawn but through the yawn. "Just describe yourself."

Aria started a bath and waited for the water to fill.  The tub was large, it had jets and everything but really Aria could care less about it's fancy features.  Aria didn't exactly want to talk she smiled, "I can do you one better."  Talking was good but showing she could have a lot more fun with.  Aria flipped on Holo mode on her wallet and set it down on the far side of the tub.  "You see alright?"

He nodded sleepily.  Aria smiled at him.  Aria started to undress.  She didn't have nearly as much as usual to take off.   Aria pulled the sticks from her hair and it fell around her neck and shoulders.  She tossed it to straighten it out some and set the sticks on the night stand.  

There was enough sexual energy in the next room over Aria didn't have to push far to get in the mood.  There was no need for music, she moved as if she were with Lucas, her hands his and she wanted so very much to feel him touching her.  
A noise made her look up. He had sat up in bed with his head against the pillow. His hair was a mess, but he no longer looked asleep. He just watched her. 

Aria bit her bottom lip at the look on his face.  She missed him.  And not just for this particular reaction, she missed everything.  But the energy flowed through her and she let it.  She removed her shirt slowly, raising it above her head.  

Aria's hands ran along her skin and elicited a soft moan.  Her ached for Lucas' touch, her hands found the button on her jeans and she undid it, and the zipper too.  Her hand pushed inside and down and Aria felt herself and how much she had missed him.

It was clear he felt the same way. He threw the covers off and she could see that he was very much awake. And staring at her. And touching himself. "Are they in the other room?"

Aria nodded.  She couldn't speak at the moment.  Her fingers were rubbing her self.

He was moving his hand slowly. "Since I'm not there, you're going to have to take what they are doing into you. And imagine it's me. And watch me."

Aria nodded and stopped the water in the tub but opted to sit back on the bed, she watched Lucas and opened herself to them.  She hadn't needed to but she did it anyway, their energy flowed through her and her body arched backwards with the sensations of it all.

He leaned forward and she could see that he was definitely aroused. He watched her, licking his lips. His hands roamed. "Keep going. Tell me what you wish you were doing."

The words could barely be heard.  "Touching you.  Any and every way possible."  Aria's body shook with everything, Nox and Jacinda were finishing a rousing bout and Aria couldn't help but release it herself.  A moan escaped and she fell back against the bed.  He shouldn't have told her to bring them in, but she was very glad for the release of her own.  

Lucas eyes were wide and he breathed faster and faster until a shudder and he too moaned. He had a smile on his face. "God, I wish you were here. That was meant for you. In you or on you." He laughed. "I'll have to save up for you I guess."

Aria blushed and smiled.  "You have no idea how much I miss you."

"I miss you too"

Aria was content to fall asleep now, but her phone was across the way and the tub was full.  She smiled.  "You should get back to bed.  I need a bath and I think my water is cold now."  She smiled playfully at him.

"Sure. Wake me up like that and then send me to bed. I don't think so. I'm up. Let's play."

Aria laughed.  And they played.

**** Aria ****

Their room was a big ball of sexual energy, Aria could tell Nox was getting his nights worth, he was exhausted, Lucas would be just about the same in the morning.  She'd let him go only moments before, much to his regret, hers too, but really she needed to drown in the tub and block out Nox and Jacinda or she'd never sleep.

And that's exactly what she did, Aria didn't run another bath, she got in and sank to the bottom and pushed away their emotions.  She thought of Lucas and came back to the surface and just laid in the water.  Aria lost track of time.

Her wallet started flashing, she couldn't hear it.  It flashed angrily at her.  Aria sat up and grabbed the phone.  "Yeah Aurora.  You've bad timing you know."

Aurora laughed, "sorry, you are a night owl I figured you'd just be waking up."

"I'm with your brother, you honestly think I can keep my normal hours?"

"Too true.  He's busy?  He won't answer the phone."  Aurora was near to giggling.

Aria shook her head.  "He's entertaining Jacinda Cross."

"What?"  The suprise in Aurora's voice was expected.  "I sent you guys some files, I need you to take a look at."

"Right now?"  Aria asked.  "He's still kinda busy and the laptop is in his room."

"Interrupt, he won't mind."  Aurora was confident, Aria not so much.

Though he was nearing exhaustion.  "Fine.  I'll call you back when I have the laptop.  I have to get dressed."

Aria could almost hear the blush in Aurora's voice, "Oh. Okay.  Call me back."

Aria pulled the plug on the tub and got dressed, she pulled a long shirt on and some panties and put her hair in a towel so it didn't drip all over everything.  Aria searched the common room and didn't find the laptop.  "Damnit Nox."

Aria knocked.  "Nox.  Your sister is trying to call you, now she's bugging me.  I need the laptop."
