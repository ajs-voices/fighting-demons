**** Nox ****

Nox sipped at one beer for over an hour, his mind reeling from the days events.  Aria and Jacinda played out in his mind, the details played over and over and it was hard to do anything other than see that, over and over.  The beer only made things worse, for once, he drank even less than usual.  Nox felt the ward go off in his head.  The alarm silently tripped as Aria got out of bed.  And again when she went back to it.  Answering the door, and it went off a third time and Nox frowned, he pulled the remainder of the beer from the bottle.  He was about to get up but decided against it.  If she wanted to sleep with Jacinda, who was he to get in the way.  It was her life, he hoped the darkness had fled in her sleep and that she was not compelled to sleep with her.

Nox ordered another beer, he'd head that way after he finished it.  His mind kept going back to what he'd seen, the fact that they were together now was playing havoc on his head.  He finished the beer quicker than the first and was walking back across the street to Aria's room.  He stood at the door way for several miniutes debating going in without knocking, it sounded like they were talking, which in the end could be worse than them sleeping together.

Nox pulled out Aria's key and opened the door.  They were having a moment, Nox could see the danger in Aria's eyes, the darkness wasn't gone completely.  And she was being a bitch about it all too.  He didn't say anything until after Jacinda left, pushing him out of the way.  He wanted to very much throw her across the room with a weave of air.  He watched her as she went back to her room, he could make it look like an accident.  He wanted to.  Nox put a hand to his head and pressed hard, his head hurt.  He turned back to Aria, he knew she hadn't called Lucas, he could see it in her eyes, but he asked anyway as he sat down.

Her words stung.  What had Jacinda said to her?  But really it didn't matter.  Nox knew he said things he hadnt' meant the moment he closed the door behind him.  He dropped the power as he fell into his own bed.  Everything hurt, his head, his body, everything hurt.  He made himself get up and take a cold shower.  Anything to get the images from his head.  But the cold shower did little good.

Nox tried to sleep, but everytime he got close the images floated through his mind and he couldn't push them away.  Once he finally did drift into nothingness, the dreams were worse.  He knew what Aria was capable of, he watched her slaughter Jacinda in his mind.  He knew it was part of his subconsious wanting it, but Aria she'd told him how she had killed that reporter, he watched in painstaking awe as she sliced through Jacinda with ease.  He started awake many times, all as Aria pulled the last breathes from her gurgled screams.  His heart pounded, his head echoed and he knew he'd not sleep for days now.  Those dreams hauting his waking moments.

Nox tried to watch the television, but opted to just lie awake staring at the ceiling.  His alarm went off, and Nox stayed in bed staring at the ceiling.  A knock came, he got up, he knew it was Aria, the only person in the world who knew him like his sister.  She bore coffee in her hand and wore an apologetic smile.  Nox opened the door wider letting her pass.  He took the cup of coffee from her as she came in.  She didn't sit down, she didn't make herself at home like usual.  He smiled but it didn't reach his eyes.  He was tired.

Nox took a swallow from the scalding hot coffee and shut the door.  He didn't have anything to say to her.  He sat down on the bed his clothes from the prior day strung out across the floor.   They stood in near silence for moments before she spoke.  "I'm sorry Nox."  The three little words and Nox felt better.  But she kept going, "I shouldn't have been mean to you."

Nox smiled at her.  "I know you didn't mean it.  And I didn't mean what I said.  You are my family, there is nothing I won't do to keep you safe."

Aria hugged him, which in and of itself was weird, but at the moment it felt right.  Though he couldn't help the reaction, he got up and went to the bathroom to pull on more clothes, all of a sudden his boxers only made him self-conscious.  He grinned at the stupidity of it, she felt everything he did.  She knew the moment it happened, she knew how he felt.

Nox heard Aria come stand by the door, to finish what she wanted to say.  "Thank you Nox.  You did something I don't think anyone else would do.  I could have killed you.  Jacinda could have, if she were in a bad mood.  You stepped between two women who could kill you easily."

Nox laughed.  "I was only afraid of you Aria.  Jacinda could hurt me, and she'd probably enjoy it too, but you, I know you.  I know the things that make you tick, it wouldn't be quick, it wouldn't be pleasant either.  You scare me Aria.  But I love you none-the-less."

He opened the door and saw the frown and the tears he picked up her chin.  "Why are you crying?"

"I don't want you to be afraid of me."

Nox laughed.  "Sorry Duckling, you are gonna have to live with that.  But it's good that way.  I have more reason to keep you away from your demons.  I don't think I want to see you go that bad again.  No more splitting up.  You stay with me, got it.  I can't protect you if I'm not there."

Aria nodded.  "Okay.  I can live with that."  Her smile was weak.  "Lucas will call you later.  Not sure when.  I'm going to go find some food for us.  More coffee?"

Nox nodded.  "Yes please.  Lots more.  I didn't sleep."

Her smile was weak again as she left, "I know."

He hated that, he really did, she knew too much about him.  It was probably one reason he felt the way he did, like she was his sister, and so much more than just a partner.  She was family, she knew him, understood him, but more importantly didn't judge him.  

Nox wasn't looking forward to talking to Lucas.  Last thing he wanted was to listen to Lucas bitch at him.  Nox drained the rest of the coffee Aria had brought with her and flopped back on the bed.  He closed his eyes and wished for sleep, dreamless sleep.  But it never came, the phone rang.

He answered it.  "Yeah?"

Lucas voice was on the other end. "Hey Nox. It's Lucas."

"She said you'd call.  What's up?"  He tried not to sound tired and annoyed.

"I just wanted to say thank you. I am really glad that you were there for her." He laughed but it wasn't real. It seemed forced. "It's a bad situation. I owe you, brother." He sighed. "This Jacinda's a piece of work isn't she."

"You have no idea.  It's not a problem, though not sure how much I can take if that's how it goes each time she's drawn in too far."  It was not something he was proud of.  He pushed everything away, he sat up.  His head hurt, he needed a pain killer, that jolt and everything else played a number on his head.

Lucas sighed again. "God, I was so afraid last night. But Aria called me and I knew she'd be ok. That she wanted to get out of wherever she was. I didn't let her know, but she sounded different at the beginning." He paused. "Seemed a bit...questioning of why I was worried. I just knew that she needed to know that I loved her no matter what. And that my life is better because of her." He was quiet for a moment. "I know she can seem scary. I think feeling like an outsider, like an alien is what has put such darkness in her. From the time she was a little girl they treated her like she was a bug, a tool. Not human. I think she has a lot of anger and rage in her." His voice got quiet. "I know a little of what it's like not to feel good enough for love. And that's all she wants. To feel loved and accepted. You and Aurora help with that. You're like a family to her. I think all of us can be her family, the people that ground her and let her know that she is worthy. You did that last night man. I thank God you were there Nox. Keep our girl safe my brother."

"Jacinda had just left, she wasn't in a good place, she was very different, not Aria.  She was being a little bitch, it's one reason why I left her room.  I'm glad she called you, she didn't want to.  Jacinda did a number on her with whatever they talked about.  Aria was falling before I interrupted.  I'll keep her as safe as she'll let me."  Nox paused, there wasn't much more to say.  "I'm so fucking tired.  I took one monster down but it did a number on me.  We'll be home soon.  We've one more hunt Aurora wants us to check out, then we'll be on a plane home, and you can see Aria again.  And then I'm sleeping for a week.  I gotta get a shower before Aria comes back with food.  If that's all man."  Nox hung up and grabbed a shower.  He couldn't decide if hot or cold would help but it all didn't matter, he was dead tired.  

Nox had finished pulling on his shirt when Aria knocked again.  Handing him a bag and coffee.  She took one cup out off the tray and the other bag with her.  Nox stood in the door way watching Aria walk to Jacinda's room and knock.  

When Jacinda answered Aria handed her everything with a smile.  "Food and coffee."  Aria nodded back towards her room.  "I need to finish getting things together, Nox is a horrible packer." She glanced back at him with a smile, he took a swallow of one of the coffee's on the tray she'd left him.  She turned back to Jacinda.  "I think you need to drive today.  He looks like a zombie."

Aria turned and walked past him to her room, Nox watched her, then turned to see Jacinda was doing the same.  He really needed to get them away from her. 

**** Aria ****

Aria woke up around 6am.  It wasn't exactly a refreshing sleep, but she was feeling better.  Lucas loved her, she loved him.  All was right with the world again.  At least it felt right, for now.  She had to apologize to Nox.  

Aria waited until his alarm would wake him up, he hadn't slept well, his emotions were all over the place.  Aria tried to block him out, but it didn't work too well, she was too used to focusing on him knowing he was there.  It was the same with Lucas and Aurora too.  And Aria sighed, it was the same with Dane as well, he just wasn't around, habits died hard.  

The coffee in the room would have to do as a peace offering.  She knew it wasn't the best, but he'd be grateful for it either way.  

He let her in and she apologized to him.  She hugged him, it was innocent, but he hadn't had a good night, Aria knew it had been a bad move, he got up and went to the bathroom, Aria could feel the tension rise, he knew what she'd felt.  It made him laugh inside, though she knew he was fighting every ounce of his strength to put things right.

Aria thanked Nox.  She was grateful he risked his life for her.  She would owe him a great many debts in the end.  And she wasn't exactly sure how to pay him back for any of it.  The fact that he was still here after the few times she'd almost gone over the deep end.  This time she did, and he was accepting of it, of her.  Again acceptance of everything she was.  Aria wondered if Lucas would ever be able to accept her for everything, or if that would break them.  But it wasn't something to dwell on now.  She was hungry, everyone else had to be as well.  

She took her leave and brought food for everyone.  She gave Nox his first, and then Jacinda.  She made some excuse to leave both of their presence for the room she called home for the night.  It was empty, and bare and she really didn't have to pack, but she sat down and prepared things, they would hit the road soon.  Hopefully Jacinda would drive so Nox could sleep.  She'd even sit and stay awake to let him.  She owed him. 

An hour later, everyone was sitting in the Jeep and they were well on they way out of town.  Nox rode in the back, he wasn't exactly sleeping, she could tell.  Aria didn't like the emotions that ran through his head while he tried to sleep, so not restful.  Aria worried about him.

The right started out quiet, everyone seemed lost in their own thoughts.  Jacinda's stories kept popping into her head, the ones she'd told her while they were alone.  The words she heard, the acceptance, the darkness.  It was all okay.  It was a tug she knew she had to fight, Jacinda didn't know what she was capable of.  Didn't understand, not completely.  No one could, not even Alex really understood.  Her father might but he was not a nice person, who tries to kill their own daughter?

Aria broke the silence with her childhood memories of the oni cave where Chi Mai had died.  The first death she'd witnessed at the hands of a monster.  She told the story like she remembered it.  She was fourteen again.  She could feel it, could feel the last breath her friend had breathed.  

Jacinda told more stories, her stories always laid into the heavy darkness, Jacinda seemed to push for the darkness, the hunger, the desire to inflict the damage on the monsters she was killing.  Saving humanity.

Aria could feel the darkness rise inside.  Knew that it was bad, but yet she could feel it, feel the power it possessed.  

The first stop they made was just to stretch their legs and take a bathroom break.  Nox stopped her and looked down on her with a frown.  He didn't say anything.  He just frowned and ran his fingers down her cheek.  It was soft and caring.  She smiled up at him.  He was trying to make her see, pull her back to reality.  She was good, people accepted who she was.  He accepted her.  But he said nothing.  It was all in her head.  At least he couldn't know what she was thinking.

The ride was full of stories.  Nox rested the entire way.  By the time they reached the little town they were going to, night had fallen, and they took up room in another motel.  Three more rooms, another night in a strange bed.  Hopefully the last one.  Now that was someting.  To go home, to sleep in her own bed, to see Lucas.  

Nox didn't look rested, he looked bad.  He really needed to sleep.  But instead he plopped down in the chair in her room with a beer he'd bought at the convience store.  He watched her as she flipped through her wallet and brought up the files for this mysterious hunt.  The time she spent looking at it Aria couldn't find anything new, they just needed to start talking to folks.  

Nox stayed in the room sipping his beer while she talked with Lucas.  It felt good to talk with Lucas, to hear his voice.  She missed him, she knew they'd be together soon.

Aria hung up with Lucas feeling better, the darkness fled whenever she talked to him.  Nox was just sitting in the chair, his eyes were open and he zoned out, Aria could tell his mind raced.  He was going to sit there in silence the whole night, watching her.  She didn't blame him.  But he needed to sleep.

"Nox you need to sleep.  Come lay down.  Let me help you."  The look he gave her was almost pure horror.  But he got up, tossed the empty beer bottle in the trash can and laid down on his back.  Aria laid down next to him, she put her hand on his and sent him calming feelings, soothing, gentle feelings, Aria could feel his mind quiet.  It let her mind quiet, he was finally resting, asleep.   Aria smiled and drifted off to sleep herself still touching Nox's hand.

Aria woke with the sun.  She grabbed a shower and pulled on clean jeans and t-shirt and sat down and waited for Nox to wake up, she scrolled through her wallet to find some of the exact locations that Aurora had said weird things had happened.  One of those places was right around the corner at a 24 hour diner.  Looks like they'd be grabbing some breakfast there.

**** Jacinda ****

Aria was up and at it early the next day. She had spunk and Jacinda liked that about her. She seemed to be back to her old self. That didn't really bother Jacinda. If anything, she was glad. It's what Aria needed to realize. Giving in to that dark part of yourself did not make you bad. It was part of what they did, becoming more than just yourself. Embracing the darkness was really just completely accepting the burdens that had been forced on you. But then, the job done, you could return to your normal self. Could laugh and joke and be casual.

Nox tried to sleep and so Aria and her talked. Stories of hunts and wounds and stuff like that. It was easy and nice. Jacinda had no agenda other than to share stories with Aria, to let her see how similar they were. Nox woke a few times and Jacinda did feel charitable toward him. She wasn't irritated anyway. He was a sweet kid, just doing what he thought was right, trying to do right by Aria. Loyalty. It was a good quality. As the day passed, her feelings toward Nox had returned to one of respect though tinged with sadness. Him and Aria- and Lucas, she couldn't forget- had this sad codependent thing going on. After hearing some of Aria's stories that included Nox she started to try to coax him into telling some. Grudgingly he complied. He was a good hunter. She didn't always get the details about how he did something, how he'd saved Aria or stopped a horde of creatures- neither of them could tell her what it was- but it was clear that he was an assett. His parents would've been proud and she told him that. He was as good as Aria, in his own way.

This new generation gave her a sense of hope. They still needed seasoning, more experience, of course. Most of all, they needed to lose their innocent naive view of the world. Again, the idea of the three of them together, as a team, resurfaced. The three of them...four if you counted Aurora- the intel person, couldn't forget her- the four of them, with her in the lead. She smiled at the thought.

That night in the hotel room, she thought about their upcoming hunt. But she also thought about her plans. Nox was the impediment to Aria. But Nox was a prize of his own. She already had some pull with him. It would be good to clear the air with him. Work on their burgeoning friendship. She got up and left her room, tip-toed to his door and knocked. No one answered. She knocked again but nothing. Maybe he was asleep. As she walked back to her room she stopped at Aria's door. Maybe he was there. She stood there for a moment, thinking. Well, tonight wasn't going to be the night. Tomorrow though. Maybe tomorrow.

She went back to her room and stripped down to nothing. She went to the mirror to look at herself. Still tight and firm. No sagging or loose skin on her. Well, maybe a little around the elbow. And there were a few lines around her eyes. But she knew she was still pretty. She turned and looked over her shoulder. Yeah, she still had it. The black dragon tattoo on her lower back had not changed its shape at all despite being 30 years old. She's gotten in while still just a teenager. Regan had gotten the artist to do it despite her being only 15. The lines were still sharp, the black still true. She often wondered what people thought of it when they saw it. Nox probably had seen it when he fixed her wounds since at the other two times they not been in a position for him to see it for long. Didn't matter. It reminded her of Regan. He had loved tracing his fingers in outline of the image. It had branded or marked her as special. She didn't really get it- she'd done it for him really- until after that night Regan died. It was then that she really understood what she was. She was glad it marked her.

She slipped under the cool covers, remembering back to those times with Regan. Memories of Aria's sweet body kept imposing themselves on her though. The feel of her skin, the taste of her lips, the look in her eyes. Jacinda didn't fight the memory and let herself enjoy it. She drifted off to sleep. 

**** Nox ****

Nox tried to sleep in the car, but it didn't work too well.  Aria and Jacinda were telling stories and Jacinda coaxed a few out of him.  Sadly details had to be left out.  They had secrets to keep from this deadly hunter.  He could tell Aria was falling down the rabbit hole again.  Jacinda seemed to coax it out of her with every word she said.  Aria's body language spoke of deadly graceful wolf, but when Jacinda pulled at Aria with the stories, he saw the change, it didn't say anything other than predator.  He shivered when he looked at her.  But he didn't say anything, he just smiled and touched her.  It was part of the game.  Partly knowing that the one touch would mean more than any thing he could have said.  Jacinda wanted to pull Aria one way, he knew how to pull her the other.  It was a game of tug-of-war.  But Jacinda would win without Lucas to guide her.  He could see it, see everything.  But there was little he could do, he was tired, he hurt, his head still pounded.

They stayed in a hotel, three rooms, but he could have only gotten two, he had no intentions of leaving Aria alone.  He sat in the chair while she did her thing, he nursed a beer.  And then she looked at him and told him he needed to sleep.  How the hell did she think she could help with that?  But what the hell.  He laid down on her bed, it wasn't the first time they'd shared a bed, funds got tight, rooms were scarce or some other reason, but everything felt different after seeing Aria with Jacinda.  She laid down, fully clothed and put her hand on his.  It was simple, and he felt her trying to calm him, sending him into a slumber he needed.  His dreams were nothing, like Aria kept them at bay.  It was not the best night sleep he'd had since he'd gotten back to the States, but it was what he needed right then.

Nox heard Aria moving about, she woke up to early, he rolled over and slept until his alarm went off.  He turned over and laid on his back and looked at Aria as she flipped through her wallet.  "Thank you."  He meant it, he had needed it.

Nox stretched and got up out of the bed and grabbed a shower.  Aria made him coffee, she was getting good at it, but he expected it was because he was a grump without it.

Showered, shaved and dressed, he felt much better.  He opened the door to the bathroom and Aria still sat in the same chair.  He bent down and kissed the top of her head.  "Really thank you."

He looked around, "What no breakfast?"

Aria grinned, "We are going to the diner for breakfast, we've rumors to hear."

He nodded.  "Ya'll are probably waiting on me huh?"

She nodded, "Yup.  She's been a wake almost as long as I have."

"Of course she has."  He refrained from rolling his eyes.  "I'll get her."

Nox went to knock on Jacinda's door.  He hoped she was dressed and ready to go.  He knocked and waited.

**** Jacinda ****

Jacinda finished lacing up her boots when she heard a knock at the door. She grabbed her coat and opened the door. It was Nox. He still looked at her with suspicion. She frowned and then went back into her room and sat in a chair. "Let's talk Nox."

Nox followed her in and closed the door.  "Okay.  About what?"  He stood against the door like he was ready to flee.

She smiled. Yeah, he was upset and on the offensive. She sighed. "Look, I know Aria's like your sister. I know you feel protective of her. I'm not trying to hurt her." It was tough to do this with him standing way over there. "Will you sit down already? This isn't a battle you know. We're on the same side."

Nox sat down on the edge of the bed with a grumble.  "You don't know what you do when you talk to Aria like that.  You have no clue what you do to her."

Jacinda raised an eyebrow curiously. She wanted to probe. But Nox was emotional. The wall could go up at any moment. Once that was up, it would be over, at least for now. And she wanted there to be peace. More than that, she wanted understanding between them.

"I know that I do not have Aria's abilities. I know that." She shook her head and sighed. "I have to scope out a scene for hours before I can start to get a feel for how the creature saw things, before I can get a sense of where it came from or went. Aria gets it instantly. I know there's more to her than just Furia. At least, from what I know of Furia. She sees things I would have seen- the way the creatures think. I'd almost say she was Sentient, if I didn't know that was impossible." She laughed. "That has to make her more vulnerable to things. But there's something you don't get Nox." She looked at him and spoke from her heart. "Regardless of how, I had the same struggle she did. You weren't even born. This was before I even knew your parents. I was good Nox. My partner, Regan, he trained me. But I had a sense about things. I got into their head. I don't know if you know about profilers. I could get into the heads of these things. It scared me because I could imagine being them. I even understood their hungers, their desires." She shook her head, remember how that scared her, the way Regan comforted her. "I found that darkness in myself all too easily."

She looked at Nox and let him see her fully, her openness. "I understand what Aria is going through because I went through it too." She looked down and then back at him. "But I learned something. As long as I fought it, it had too much power over me. It wanted to come out in terrible ways. I had some horrible fantasies Nox. Things I won't tell anyone, even now, decades later. By repressing it, by fighting it, I had no control over it." She put her hand on hers. "When I let go *during* the fight, when I let it engulf me *while* I was fighting evil, I purged myself. It came out in a good way, protecting humanity." She smiled, trying to convey to him the relief that she'd felt after that first night, the night Regan had been killed and she gave in. "God, Nox, when I let go, I fought better than I ever had in my life. I was a machine and the rougs, they died terrifed. Which was right. They tortured us, fed on us, viewed us as weak animals. But that night, I was the thing of their nightmares. You have to know what that felt like. You know what they do. But when I was done, when it was over and I had buried Regan and continued on my own, my own struggles had ended. I could profile a creature, could get in its head, could do it all. But there were no fantasies. No nightmares. Nothing. Once I embraced it, I got control."

She looked at Nox, quietly breathing. "As long as a person fights the darkness it comes out in other ways. But if you embrace it, you gain control. I wanted Aria to understand that.  You should understand that too, Nox. You! You are a great hunter. I can tell just from the things I've seen of you." She smiled. "Can you imagine the three of us? What we could do?" She laughed. "Makes me laugh just seeing the rougs or oni's shitting themselves at know that we were coming for them."

**** Nox ****

Nox listened to her tale.  He understood to a degree, but he knew things Jacinda didn't, she suspected though.  Nox wondered what she would do if she found out Aria was Sentient.  But it wasn't his secret to tell and he wouldn't let her know, not like this anyway.

He spoke out loud, but it was his thoughts he wasn't sure how much sense he'd make.  "See it's not the problem.  It's the after that's the problem.  She embraces the darkness.  She can't come back from it.  The first time it happened, I didn't know her.  But she's told me what it was like.  Everything inside her was dead.  She didn't care anymore.  She sat with a gun on her knees contemplating killing herself.  It wasn't until a bad confrontation with her ..."  How does one put Dane in to perspective, "her friend that guided her to the path she's on now that she found anger, felt something.  That's when she met Lucas.  You don't like Lucas I get that, you think it makes her weak.  It doesn't.  Aria embraces all parts of herself.  Her only problem is that she believes she's not worthy of anything.  You could be her heaven and earth with a drop of a hat.  You could guide her, instead of tempt her into the darkness.  The darkness will kill her, it will kill you.  And it'll kill anyone who touches her.  Aria was a great hunter before the darkness took over, she's intelligent and stronger than you'll ever know.  But she doubts everything about herself.  She doesn't need the darkness to be great, she is great.  She is who she is and I love her for it.  She doesn't care if you have a dark past, doesn't care if you been an all around good person, her life is built to save people.  It's all she knows, but that darkness, it will kill those people she wants to save.  I've followed her when she went out without me.  She pulled herself back from the moments she wanted to kill a girl, for no other reason than she could.  The girl to my knowledge was not a monster, just a girl who wouldn't be missed.  Aria is not the sanest of people.  She doesn't need to be to do what she does.  I'm not going to tell you not to talk to Aria, not to try to get through to her, but I think you are doing it the wrong way."

**** Jacinda ****

Jacinda listened. She wasn't a fool. What Nox described was more than what he struggled with. Then again, she'd already known that. If Jacinda had her struggle just from her own abitlity to have an almost intuitive empathy then how much more so a girl like Aria.

But Nox was wrong. Everything he described about Aria was a darker shadow of what Jacinda had struggled with. The fantasies she'd had were very similar to what he described in Aria. Lack of opportunity or something else kept her from acting on it. But she'd wanted to. And who knew? After 10 years of repression, when she was Aria's age, she may very well have also killed a girl who no one would have missed just because she'd wanted to. He didn't get it. Aria was just like her. More vulnerable because of her abilities, the hungers darker. But just like her.

She sighed. "There are two ways. Repression and acceptance with an outlet. I think Aria is stronger than you think. Not enough to withstand the repression. You and Lucas and Aurora can be there all you like, try to keep her from going there, but the desire will build. Eventually, all that pressure is going to come out. Explosively. It's simple physics, Nox." She smiled weakly. She wished he'd understand. "I'm saying that *if* she can let off her steam- embrace that darkness during the hunt- the fight- then she will be able to live with that pressure. It will never take control of her." She remembered back to the face she'd seen on Aria when Nox took her, when they had been fucking. It was animal. But it made sense. All this repression, all this pressure, all these rules hemming her in- and then to stop her when she was in the middle of blowing off steam, when they are in the middle of pleasuring each other- what the fuck did he expect? But he couldn't hear that. "Just think about it. Think about how *long* it had been since Aria had let out some of the pressure. Think about it building in her. And then you can decide whether you think its better for her to do it your way or mine. My way may have her crazy for a little while. But she'll come out it. You showed that, if nothing else. I know you knocked her out. It wasn't a bad decision. And how is she today? The pressure is gone. She let it out just a little bit and it helped. Just think about that."

She got up and went to the door. "We better go and see what our first plan of action is." She paused, thinking. Nox was wound pretty tight too. "You might think about that for yourself too, Nox. You don't have to be Furia or Sentient to struggle. Trust me, I know. Pressure builds in all of us." She smiled at him and walked out.

****  Nox ****

Maybe she was right, but if she were wrong, the world would pay.  Nox let it go, didn't say anything, he'd think about it.  She paused to say he might be wound too tight, she had no clue what the hell was going on with him.  Yeah he knew about his own dark places.  But he wasn't wound tightly, he had his outlets.  He grinned as he new she was one of those outlets the last couple times.  

Jacinda left to find the plan, Nox stood up and followed behind her.  "Aria says we are having breakfast at the diner around the corner.  She's looking for the rumors while we eat I guess."  

Aria stood against the wall waiting, she smiled at them, it was her you took long enough smile.  Nox grinned at her.  "I'm starving."  He put his arm around Jacinda's shoulder and one around Aria's.  He felt better, alot better now that he'd some sleep.  His mind still reeled from the images in his dreams and in reality but he could at least fake it most of the time now.

**** Aria ****

Nox was feeling better, or at least putting on a good face.  He was tired, confused and a mixed bag of emotions on the inside, but he was Nox on the outside.  It was good to see him being 'happy' again even though Aria knew the truth of it all.  There probably wasn't much she could do to help either.  She had a big feeling she was part of the problem.  It made her sad.  But they'd get through it, it's what they did afterall.

The diner was around the corner, almost literally.  They walked with Nox in between hanging on them with a stupid grin.  He was on top of the world to everyone on the outside.  Inside the diner was quaint.  A typical dinner, at the counter a few locals sat, a family in the booth by the bathroom.  They sat near the entrance, mostly because it was in the center and could easily hear most of the mining area, they were after rumors after all.  Weird things don't happen in small towns without everyone talking about it.  Even in big cities it happened, but it wasn't really more than that, rumors.  In a small town like this, well, it was people they knew, the tones were quiet, the implications large.  They had to tread lightly on this one.

The waitress came to the table, she was pretty, if you liked the girl next door type, she was dressed in the god-awful diner uniform, which I'm sure looks great on the models, but for normal girls not so much.  She had her brown hair pulled back into a braid, her little white apron had drying coffee stains on it.  Accidents happen Aria supposed.  She hoped it wasn't her fault.  

She handed them the menus and Nox brushed her hand against hers.  He was really putting on a good happy show for the world.  His heart wasn't in it, not really.  But no one would notice.  "Duckling, can you please bring me and my friend here a pot of coffee, and keep it full."  Nox nodded to Aria with a grin, "She'll have a water."

Aria nodded, "What he said."  She left with a smile and Aria kicked Nox under the table.  "We can order our own food."

He laughed and patted her hand.  "I know.  Women and their femenism."  He grinned in playfulness.  While he felt all mixed up inside, Aria knew he was doing his best to not be that way.  She smiled at him.  He was trying.  

The waitress came back with their drinks, Nox let her pour the first cup of coffee but he was pouring a second before the orders were even taken.  Aria ordered a simple breakfast, eggs, bacon and some toast.  Nox ordered about half the menu before he drowned another cup of coffee.  He had to be burning his mouth with its heat, but he didn't seam to care. Which Aria thought was not a good thing.  Aria wondered what they'd talked about, he probably wondered what her and Jacinda had talked about too.  They probably needed to sit down and talk about it all.

As their food arrived a woman came in, she looked exasperated, she was not hysterical, but she felt like someone who thought she was going crazy.  Aria watched the woman as she sat down at the counter and ordered coffee and pie.  Pie first thing in the morning, suppose it was a comfort food.  

Their waitress stopped in front of the woman and patted her hand.  "Chris having issues again?"

The woman nodded as she took a sip of her hot coffee.  It was hot enough that she set it back down and put her hand to her lips as if it would cool it down.  Aria looked to Nox and wondered if he had cooled his coffee down.  She hadn't noticed him going into emptiness, but maybe he was doing it quickly.  Aria sighed to herself, his and Aurora's power was still new to them all.  And the two were completely different from each other, Aurora would understand one thing and Nox would counter it with the opposite, yet both clearly worked.  It was a mystery, much like this little adventure.

The woman shook as if she were crying.  She sat there with tears soaking her pie.  Aria smiled at Nox.  "Nox, dear, I think the woman at the counter is someone you should talk to."

**** Nox ****

Nox flirted with the waitress, but he wasn't really feeling it.  But she was cute, though she was probably in a relationship or had some kid or another working in a diner like this.  Though if you are down and out you took what you could get, Aurora worked a shit hole like this for a few weeks once after their Dad passed.  It was short lived, and just enough to pay for the stupid motel that they had been staying in.  It wasn't long until the Atharim pay checks rolled in, they got the money instead of good ol' dad.  Maybe he'd have not drank as much if they'd had their own money they earned.  But it went into his pockets and he used it.  

Aria was watching the crowd, he wondered what she was reading off of them.  If it had been the two of them they'd have their heads together whispering, looking like a couple keeping secrets. He laughed inside at that, how wrong appearances were.

Aria implied someone was a suspect, or at least was someone worth talking to.  The woman was about Jacinda's age, but she was hardly Jacinda.  She looked like she'd popped out a kid or three, her wedding band was sparkling away on her hand.  But she looked tired, looked like she was going to break down right there.  He trusted Aria.  He poured another cup of coffee and slide out of the booth.

Nox put on his best smile and sat down next to the woman.  He nodded to her when she looked at him.  She smiled weakly back.  "You look like you know what's good on the menu?  I'll have what she's having."  The waitress frowed at him and Nox gave her a wink.  She placed a plate of peach pie in front of him.  Really, it had to be peach.  He'd have to actually look next time.  He took a bite.  "Are you alright, Duckling?"  He picked up her chin and wiped a tear away.  "A pretty girl like you shouldn't be crying.  And if it's over a man, point him out.  I'll teach him a thing or two."

The woman pulled away from him.  "No I'm alright.  My husband...he's just been having strange things happen to him.  And now, he's lying at home dying and I don't know what to do."

"Husband, ah, I see."  He sounded disappointed, he was hoping for more information though.  "Strange things?"

She nodded, "You wouldn't believe me if I told you."

Nox grinned.  "Try me, I bet there isn't anything you can say that I haven't heard already."

She looked at him with eyes as big as saucers, she was shocked to hear that.  Nox nodded, "Trust me."  He put his hand on hers.  He hoped she'd trust him.

She leaned in.  "You really wouldn't beleive me.  My son fell out of our second story window, I could have sworn he was going to fall on to the rod iron gates, you know those ones with the sharp arrow points at the top.  But he didn't, it was like a gust of wind pushed him out of the way.  My husband said it was nothing, nothing but the wind.  But then there was this fire, an explosion, and my husband escaped while no one else did.  He's been sick so much lately."

Nox knew exactly what was happening.  However he didn't exactly want to relay the message to Jacinda.  He'd have to tell Aria later, at least the who, he'd give them both the weirdness.

Nox nodded to the woman, he stood up and walked behind her and whispered in her ear.  "I beleive you.  I'd like to meet your husband sometime soon."  Nox slipped the woman a slip of paper he'd jotted down his number on.  "Call me if the weird happens again."

Nox slide back into the booth.  "She's seen weird things happen first hand.  Wind blowing kids away from fences, a fire only one person has survived.  Sounds like we've a godling in our midst, somewhere."

Nox was anxious, he had practiced not showing it to people but he knew Aria knew.  He wondered if Jacinda's extended empathy for monsters went for goldings too.  He was starting to get worried, what if she found out his secret.  It was bad enough she suspected Aria was more than Furia, but he was a godling.  He was what the Atharim really fought against.  

**** Jacinda ****

The morning had been uneventful. Nox had gone for affability- draping an arm on both of them as if they were his girls. He very nearly got a broken rib as a nice reminder of who Jacinda was. She wasn't anyone's girl. Regan had been the last to call her that and that was 25 years ago. Idly, she wondered if she'd still feel that way now, had he lived. He was about 30 years older than her. That would put him in his 70s. He'd not be out on missions that's for sure. And while his being in his 40s when he'd first taken her had been ok with her then, she wasn't sure that liver-spotted hands and atrophied muscle and thinning hair would have appealed to her now. Then again, if he had lived, they would've spent it together and that might not have bothered her at all.

That he might have ditched her for another teenage girl didn't occur to her. At least not consciously. But when she thought about it, on the main she liked the younger guys. Not only because they were physically more appealing but also because it gave her a sense of power. There was never any question of who was dominant in their relationship. Indeed, that element of the power imbalance made things that much better. Had Regan lived, that might have complicated things. In the end, he, like her parents, had not been good enough, strong enough, or fast enough. It was she, the young girl, who'd not only survived, but had exacted vengeance on the rougs that had orphaned her for a third time. And it was her who had gone on to continue the hunt for the next 30 years. She was stronger even than Regan had been. It was something to think about.

They got to the diner and hunkered down. She ordered chicken fried steak and eggs, a side of pancakes and coffee. The last few days had been taxing, phsyically and emotionally. Stick to your ribs food was what she craved. What did interest her, though, was Aria's reading of the restaurant. Jacinda watched her carefully. She'd read the literature on Furia and had always thought it was heavily dependent on smells- more specifically pheremones- in the room. Aria's technique didn't seem to be dependent on that. At least, the diner was filled with the smells of food and coffee. She couldn't tell if the waitress wore perfume, though very likely not. You don't put on one of those unflattering uniforms and a coffee-stained apron and then perfume as if you are trying to attract a guy. Point being, how Aria could sift through the crowded restaurant and pinpoint someone for Nox to check out was a mystery.

More and more, she suspected Aria was not a Furia at all. It fit, actually. If she was a Sentient, then her...darkness- her struggle- took on an added dimension. It didn't change what Jacinda said or what she felt- the things she told Nox had been the simple truth. People like them- her, Aria and even Nox himself- needed an outlet or else they would explode in uncontrolled ways.

Strangley, realizing that Aria was likely Sentient did not send her into the "other" category- the monsters who needed to be put down. She'd already developed an understanding of Furia- a trait that allowed one to tell what people were dangerous and had done violence likely based on a host of subconcious indicators. She had her own version of special abilities that she knew came from training and natural instinct and skill. Furia were just another level of that. And from what she'd seen of Aria, she was prepared to believe the same thing. Of course, any skill that was perverted in its use- used for evil or something like that- could condemn a person to death in her eyes. But fundementally, Aria was still human. She didn't think she was a wolf or anything. She didn't touch power that would drive her mad and lead to the death of others like the godlings she'd put down.

She decided to be blunt. "You're not Furia are you? Sentient right?"

**** Aria ****

Aria didn't watch Nox as he left to go tend to the woman's story.  But she never stopped listening to the emotions going through her, she could track the woman anywhere she want in the small town now.  She could follow her and find her as long as she didn't get on something moving fast, and had many stops, etc.  A car was easy to track, but mass transpotation not so much.  

Aria poked at her food mostly, not extremely hungry.  But she nearly choked on the piece of bacon when Jacinda asked her if she was Sentient.  Aria looked up from her plate to see where Nox was, he was fine, but Aria now had a situation she'd rather not have.  

"And if I am?"  Aria looked back down at her plate and took a bite of her eggs.  All appeitite was gone now.  But she'd at least act like she didn't care one way or the other.

Jacinda smiled amused. "It's alright sweetheart. I understand. You just are far too good to simply be Furia." She paused, as if unsure to go on. "I believe in what we do. But from what I've seen, you are Atharim to the core."

Aria relaxed for now, but she wasn't going to let up all that much on this, Jacinda could easily take her and Nox, if Nox was not going to use his power and out himself.  It better not go badly.  Aria looked up.  "I was trained to be Furia.  My files all say Furia.  I didn't know I wasn't Furia until a few months back."  Aria laughed.  "Went to Vactican City, where I grew up, to retreive a book in their archives.  But what I found wasn't just that book, found a whole lot more."  Aria wasn't going to mention seeing the Regus, and her mission.  That was the last thing she wanted anyone to know, particularly in a country that disliked the CCD as a whole.  

"My mentor, who apparently enjoyed lying to me my whole life, not just about what I was, but who he was.  He threw me under the bus.  Eventually I'm sure the secret won't be quite so secret anymore."

Jacinda listened, saying little, though nodding at times. When Aria was done, she didn't say anything at first. Instead she had a slight smile and then shook her head. "Talk about darkness huh. I get it hun, I do." She reached out a hand and touched Aria's. "The struggle is never ending. It's never going to stop. I hope you take my advice. I may not be Sentient or Furia but I know what it's like to want to make the world pay. It's made me stronger of course. But that darkness is still inside me. If I deny it or repress it it only gets stronger. So I've learned to live with it, to let it out when *I* choose to. *I* am in control." She smiled. "Life it a brutal contest Aria. Kill or be killed. That's it. You and I- and even Nox there- we are all in this contest. Our enemies are the most vile and powerful creatures imaginable. And yet everyday, we fight them and we win." Her smile became a wide grin. "We win Aria. You are strong enough to do this. I believe you can. I don't think the darkness will consume you." She shrugged and took her hand away. "Simple as that. I think that you will win this- if you let me help you." She looked over and saw Nox coming this way. She fell silent and waited for him to sit and report.

There was much to think about what Jacinda said, but Aria was glad for Nox's interruption.  It meant work and work was always more enjoyable than the fluffy talk about her emotions.  It was one thing to talk with Lucas about it.  But Jacinda was a relative stranger, like or not was not a question.  Aria had enough emotions to go around she didn't like talking about the way she felt.  And her darkness was her own personal struggle.  

Aria knew Nox was keeping something from them.  And once he mentioned godlings, she had an idea what might be the issue.  The woman had revealed more than Nox was telling, she was sure of that.

"Any indications of where the strange things happened?"  Aria asked, Nox looked rather ashamed, he'd forgotten to ask.  Aria grinned at him.  

The waitress happened to be picking up some empty plates at the near by table and stopped with a smile.  "I don't mean to interrupt, but those strange things are happening all over the place.  The Keen house, out just past the interstate was an explosion for no reason.  And Howe's Cavern has been seeing some weird things happening too.  No one knows what's going on.  A few months back there was an incident back at Old Mr. Kray's house, he said that he saw a ghost, his dead wife came to him.  But I don't think it was her, even as a ghost, he was dilerious before that.  The woman you were talking to, that's her father.  But he's fine now, no more dementia."  The waitress shrugged.  "I don't know why you'd want to know about the weird things here."

Aria smiled.  "Thanks.  Can you tell us where the last incident was?"

The waitress nodded, "The fire out by the interstate.  It's a contruction site.  Well it was."

"Appreciate it."

**** Nox ****

The waitress gave them some good intel, Nox would have to tip her well.  Not that he would have done otherwise.  She kept his coffee full.  And that was almost as important as the intel.

Aria did look better today, but she'd talked to Lucas last night, for a good while.  He hadn't paid much attention.  He was starting to doubt his knowledge of things, maybe Jacinda was right.  But that wasn't for now, he needed to talk to Aria, alone, but that didn't look likely to happen.  They had looked like they were sharing another moment.  He wondered about what.

Nox finished what he'd ordered, he was still rather hungry, he wasn't exactly sure why, maybe it was nerves, maybe just too much pent up energy.  But he didn't think there was going to be a fight in this round.  Neither he nor Aria wanted to kill this man.  He hadn't done anything bad.  Nox wished Aurora's intel had been a little more in depth, and that Jacinda hadn't been there, or here now.  The man just needed to learn what he was so he stopped using it without knowing.  The sickness was going to kill him, and from the way his wife reacted, it seemed pretty bad now.  He remembered that day he got sick, before he could control it.  It was horrible.  He shuddered.

Aria took the lead, she pushed him out of the booth.  Nox drained the last of his coffee and dropped the last of his American cash on the table.  It wasn't much, it was credits from here on out.  Thankfully they were almost done, and hopefully not too many more cash transactions needed to be taken care of.

Aria paid the bill at the counter. He'd yet to see Jacinda fork out any money willingly, she'd paid sure, he thought she had anyway, but he or Aria seemed to catch most of it.  He didn't mind, not really.  It all came from the same place.  And in another week more would magically appear in his account, and he'd fork over his rent automatically and pay the other bills and then the rest was his, in Moscow expenses were easy, credit was easy with the Atharim issued accounts he had now.  Just had to do the paperwork.  He'd let Aria do that, she was used to it, he hated it.  Aurora ended up doing his.  But he almost always made sure she took care of things anyway.  

Jacinda headed out to the Jeep.  "Jacinda."  He tossed her the keys as she turned around.  

He followed Aria to the counter.  He stood behind her and spoke softly.  "I know who the godling is, don't find the trail."

Aria turned around and looked up at him, those piercing green eyes showed her concern for the lies they were about to tell.  Or maybe it was something else.  

She didn't smile.  "She knows."

Now he was concerned, there was alot of things she and knows could mean.  She put her hand on his arm and turned him towards the door.  Nox followed instructions well.  Aria continued, "She knows what I am."

He grinned, "I knew she suspected.  You are still here, that's good.  We stick together Aria, always.  No more splitting up."

Aria nodded and they walked out to the Jeep.  Aria got in the back seat leaving him the shot gun position.  Jacinda drove them out to the construction site.  There really wasn't much left of it.  It was pretty much a burnt shell of a building now.  Nox wondered what it was going to be.  Nothing but ash now more than likely.

They walked around.  He wasn't sure if Aria could track the man from here.  If it was an accident, then he wasn't sure what they'd find.  A godling was not the same as a monster, and untrained ones were worse, they didn't have motive, or emotions other than fear and worry.  They didn't know what they were doing.  Maybe Aria wouldn't even be able to track the guy.
