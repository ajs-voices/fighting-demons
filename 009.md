**** Nox ****

Nox sipped at one beer for over an hour, his mind reeling from the days events.  Aria and Jacinda played out in his mind, the details played over and over and it was hard to do anything other than see that, over and over.  The beer only made things worse, for once, he drank even less than usual.  Nox felt the ward go off in his head.  The alarm silently tripped as Aria got out of bed.  And again when she went back to it.  Answering the door, and it went off a third time and Nox frowned, he pulled the remainder of the beer from the bottle.  He was about to get up but decided against it.  If she wanted to sleep with Jacinda, who was he to get in the way.  It was her life, he hoped the darkness had fled in her sleep and that she was not compelled to sleep with her.

Nox ordered another beer, he'd head that way after he finished it.  His mind kept going back to what he'd seen, the fact that they were together now was playing havoc on his head.  He finished the beer quicker than the first and was walking back across the street to Aria's room.  He stood at the door way for several miniutes debating going in without knocking, it sounded like they were talking, which in the end could be worse than them sleeping together.

Nox pulled out Aria's key and opened the door.  They were having a moment, Nox could see the danger in Aria's eyes, the darkness wasn't gone completely.  And she was being a bitch about it all too.  He didn't say anything until after Jacinda left, pushing him out of the way.  He wanted to very much throw her across the room with a weave of air.  He watched her as she went back to her room, he could make it look like an accident.  He wanted to.  Nox put a hand to his head and pressed hard, his head hurt.  He turned back to Aria, he knew she hadn't called Lucas, he could see it in her eyes, but he asked anyway as he sat down.

Her words stung.  What had Jacinda said to her?  But really it didn't matter.  Nox knew he said things he hadnt' meant the moment he closed the door behind him.  He dropped the power as he fell into his own bed.  Everything hurt, his head, his body, everything hurt.  He made himself get up and take a cold shower.  Anything to get the images from his head.  But the cold shower did little good.

Nox tried to sleep, but everytime he got close the images floated through his mind and he couldn't push them away.  Once he finally did drift into nothingness, the dreams were worse.  He knew what Aria was capable of, he watched her slaughter Jacinda in his mind.  He knew it was part of his subconsious wanting it, but Aria she'd told him how she had killed that reporter, he watched in painstaking awe as she sliced through Jacinda with ease.  He started awake many times, all as Aria pulled the last breathes from her gurgled screams.  His heart pounded, his head echoed and he knew he'd not sleep for days now.  Those dreams hauting his waking moments.

Nox tried to watch the television, but opted to just lie awake staring at the ceiling.  His alarm went off, and Nox stayed in bed staring at the ceiling.  A knock came, he got up, he knew it was Aria, the only person in the world who knew him like his sister.  She bore coffee in her hand and wore an apologetic smile.  Nox opened the door wider letting her pass.  He took the cup of coffee from her as she came in.  She didn't sit down, she didn't make herself at home like usual.  He smiled but it didn't reach his eyes.  He was tired.

Nox took a swallow from the scalding hot coffee and shut the door.  He didn't have anything to say to her.  He sat down on the bed his clothes from the prior day strung out across the floor.   They stood in near silence for moments before she spoke.  "I'm sorry Nox."  The three little words and Nox felt better.  But she kept going, "I shouldn't have been mean to you."

Nox smiled at her.  "I know you didn't mean it.  And I didn't mean what I said.  You are my family, there is nothing I won't do to keep you safe."

Aria hugged him, which in and of itself was weird, but at the moment it felt right.  Though he couldn't help the reaction, he got up and went to the bathroom to pull on more clothes, all of a sudden his boxers only made him self-conscious.  He grinned at the stupidity of it, she felt everything he did.  She knew the moment it happened, she knew how he felt.

Nox heard Aria come stand by the door, to finish what she wanted to say.  "Thank you Nox.  You did something I don't think anyone else would do.  I could have killed you.  Jacinda could have, if she were in a bad mood.  You stepped between two women who could kill you easily."

Nox laughed.  "I was only afraid of you Aria.  Jacinda could hurt me, and she'd probably enjoy it too, but you, I know you.  I know the things that make you tick, it wouldn't be quick, it wouldn't be pleasant either.  You scare me Aria.  But I love you none-the-less."

He opened the door and saw the frown and the tears he picked up her chin.  "Why are you crying?"

"I don't want you to be afraid of me."

Nox laughed.  "Sorry Duckling, you are gonna have to live with that.  But it's good that way.  I have more reason to keep you away from your demons.  I don't think I want to see you go that bad again.  No more splitting up.  You stay with me, got it.  I can't protect you if I'm not there."

Aria nodded.  "Okay.  I can live with that."  Her smile was weak.  "Lucas will call you later.  Not sure when.  I'm going to go find some food for us.  More coffee?"

Nox nodded.  "Yes please.  Lots more.  I didn't sleep."

Her smile was weak again as she left, "I know."

He hated that, he really did, she knew too much about him.  It was probably one reason he felt the way he did, like she was his sister, and so much more than just a partner.  She was family, she knew him, understood him, but more importantly didn't judge him.  

Nox wasn't looking forward to talking to Lucas.  Last thing he wanted was to listen to Lucas bitch at him.  Nox drained the rest of the coffee Aria had brought with her and flopped back on the bed.  He closed his eyes and wished for sleep, dreamless sleep.  But it never came, the phone rang.

He answered it.  "Yeah?"

Lucas voice was on the other end. "Hey Nox. It's Lucas."

"She said you'd call.  What's up?"  He tried not to sound tired and annoyed.

"I just wanted to say thank you. I am really glad that you were there for her." He laughed but it wasn't real. It seemed forced. "It's a bad situation. I owe you, brother." He sighed. "This Jacinda's a piece of work isn't she."

"You have no idea.  It's not a problem, though not sure how much I can take if that's how it goes each time she's drawn in too far."  It was not something he was proud of.  He pushed everything away, he sat up.  His head hurt, he needed a pain killer, that jolt and everything else played a number on his head.

Lucas sighed again. "God, I was so afraid last night. But Aria called me and I knew she'd be ok. That she wanted to get out of wherever she was. I didn't let her know, but she sounded different at the beginning." He paused. "Seemed a bit...questioning of why I was worried. I just knew that she needed to know that I loved her no matter what. And that my life is better because of her." He was quiet for a moment. "I know she can seem scary. I think feeling like an outsider, like an alien is what has put such darkness in her. From the time she was a little girl they treated her like she was a bug, a tool. Not human. I think she has a lot of anger and rage in her." His voice got quiet. "I know a little of what it's like not to feel good enough for love. And that's all she wants. To feel loved and accepted. You and Aurora help with that. You're like a family to her. I think all of us can be her family, the people that ground her and let her know that she is worthy. You did that last night man. I thank God you were there Nox. Keep our girl safe my brother."

"Jacinda had just left, she wasn't in a good place, she was very different, not Aria.  She was being a little bitch, it's one reason why I left her room.  I'm glad she called you, she didn't want to.  Jacinda did a number on her with whatever they talked about.  Aria was falling before I interrupted.  I'll keep her as safe as she'll let me."  Nox paused, there wasn't much more to say.  "I'm so fucking tired.  I took one monster down but it did a number on me.  We'll be home soon.  We've one more hunt Aurora wants us to check out, then we'll be on a plane home, and you can see Aria again.  And then I'm sleeping for a week.  I gotta get a shower before Aria comes back with food.  If that's all man."  Nox hung up and grabbed a shower.  He couldn't decide if hot or cold would help but it all didn't matter, he was dead tired.  

Nox had finished pulling on his shirt when Aria knocked again.  Handing him a bag and coffee.  She took one cup out off the tray and the other bag with her.  Nox stood in the door way watching Aria walk to Jacinda's room and knock.  

When Jacinda answered Aria handed her everything with a smile.  "Food and coffee."  Aria nodded back towards her room.  "I need to finish getting things together, Nox is a horrible packer." She glanced back at him with a smile, he took a swallow of one of the coffee's on the tray she'd left him.  She turned back to Jacinda.  "I think you need to drive today.  He looks like a zombie."

Aria turned and walked past him to her room, Nox watched her, then turned to see Jacinda was doing the same.  He really needed to get them away from her. 

**** Aria ****

Aria woke up around 6am.  It wasn't exactly a refreshing sleep, but she was feeling better.  Lucas loved her, she loved him.  All was right with the world again.  At least it felt right, for now.  She had to apologize to Nox.  

Aria waited until his alarm would wake him up, he hadn't slept well, his emotions were all over the place.  Aria tried to block him out, but it didn't work too well, she was too used to focusing on him knowing he was there.  It was the same with Lucas and Aurora too.  And Aria sighed, it was the same with Dane as well, he just wasn't around, habits died hard.  

The coffee in the room would have to do as a peace offering.  She knew it wasn't the best, but he'd be grateful for it either way.  

He let her in and she apologized to him.  She hugged him, it was innocent, but he hadn't had a good night, Aria knew it had been a bad move, he got up and went to the bathroom, Aria could feel the tension rise, he knew what she'd felt.  It made him laugh inside, though she knew he was fighting every ounce of his strength to put things right.

Aria thanked Nox.  She was grateful he risked his life for her.  She would owe him a great many debts in the end.  And she wasn't exactly sure how to pay him back for any of it.  The fact that he was still here after the few times she'd almost gone over the deep end.  This time she did, and he was accepting of it, of her.  Again acceptance of everything she was.  Aria wondered if Lucas would ever be able to accept her for everything, or if that would break them.  But it wasn't something to dwell on now.  She was hungry, everyone else had to be as well.  

She took her leave and brought food for everyone.  She gave Nox his first, and then Jacinda.  She made some excuse to leave both of their presence for the room she called home for the night.  It was empty, and bare and she really didn't have to pack, but she sat down and prepared things, they would hit the road soon.  Hopefully Jacinda would drive so Nox could sleep.  She'd even sit and stay awake to let him.  She owed him. 

An hour later, everyone was sitting in the Jeep and they were well on they way out of town.  Nox rode in the back, he wasn't exactly sleeping, she could tell.  Aria didn't like the emotions that ran through his head while he tried to sleep, so not restful.  Aria worried about him.

The right started out quiet, everyone seemed lost in their own thoughts.  Jacinda's stories kept popping into her head, the ones she'd told her while they were alone.  The words she heard, the acceptance, the darkness.  It was all okay.  It was a tug she knew she had to fight, Jacinda didn't know what she was capable of.  Didn't understand, not completely.  No one could, not even Alex really understood.  Her father might but he was not a nice person, who tries to kill their own daughter?

Aria broke the silence with her childhood memories of the oni cave where Chi Mai had died.  The first death she'd witnessed at the hands of a monster.  She told the story like she remembered it.  She was fourteen again.  She could feel it, could feel the last breath her friend had breathed.  

Jacinda told more stories, her stories always laid into the heavy darkness, Jacinda seemed to push for the darkness, the hunger, the desire to inflict the damage on the monsters she was killing.  Saving humanity.

Aria could feel the darkness rise inside.  Knew that it was bad, but yet she could feel it, feel the power it possessed.  

The first stop they made was just to stretch their legs and take a bathroom break.  Nox stopped her and looked down on her with a frown.  He didn't say anything.  He just frowned and ran his fingers down her cheek.  It was soft and caring.  She smiled up at him.  He was trying to make her see, pull her back to reality.  She was good, people accepted who she was.  He accepted her.  But he said nothing.  It was all in her head.  At least he couldn't know what she was thinking.

The ride was full of stories.  Nox rested the entire way.  By the time they reached the little town they were going to, night had fallen, and they took up room in another motel.  Three more rooms, another night in a strange bed.  Hopefully the last one.  Now that was someting.  To go home, to sleep in her own bed, to see Lucas.  

Nox didn't look rested, he looked bad.  He really needed to sleep.  But instead he plopped down in the chair in her room with a beer he'd bought at the convience store.  He watched her as she flipped through her wallet and brought up the files for this mysterious hunt.  The time she spent looking at it Aria couldn't find anything new, they just needed to start talking to folks.  

Nox stayed in the room sipping his beer while she talked with Lucas.  It felt good to talk with Lucas, to hear his voice.  She missed him, she knew they'd be together soon.

Aria hung up with Lucas feeling better, the darkness fled whenever she talked to him.  Nox was just sitting in the chair, his eyes were open and he zoned out, Aria could tell his mind raced.  He was going to sit there in silence the whole night, watching her.  She didn't blame him.  But he needed to sleep.

"Nox you need to sleep.  Come lay down.  Let me help you."  The look he gave her was almost pure horror.  But he got up, tossed the empty beer bottle in the trash can and laid down on his back.  Aria laid down next to him, she put her hand on his and sent him calming feelings, soothing, gentle feelings, Aria could feel his mind quiet.  It let her mind quiet, he was finally resting, asleep.   Aria smiled and drifted off to sleep herself still touching Nox's hand.

Aria woke with the sun.  She grabbed a shower and pulled on clean jeans and t-shirt and sat down and waited for Nox to wake up, she scrolled through her wallet to find some of the exact locations that Aurora had said weird things had happened.  One of those places was right around the corner at a 24 hour diner.  Looks like they'd be grabbing some breakfast there.

**** Jacinda ****

Aria was up and at it early the next day. She had spunk and Jacinda liked that about her. She seemed to be back to her old self. That didn't really bother Jacinda. If anything, she was glad. It's what Aria needed to realize. Giving in to that dark part of yourself did not make you bad. It was part of what they did, becoming more than just yourself. Embracing the darkness was really just completely accepting the burdens that had been forced on you. But then, the job done, you could return to your normal self. Could laugh and joke and be casual.

Nox tried to sleep and so Aria and her talked. Stories of hunts and wounds and stuff like that. It was easy and nice. Jacinda had no agenda other than to share stories with Aria, to let her see how similar they were. Nox woke a few times and Jacinda did feel charitable toward him. She wasn't irritated anyway. He was a sweet kid, just doing what he thought was right, trying to do right by Aria. Loyalty. It was a good quality. As the day passed, her feelings toward Nox had returned to one of respect though tinged with sadness. Him and Aria- and Lucas, she couldn't forget- had this sad codependent thing going on. After hearing some of Aria's stories that included Nox she started to try to coax him into telling some. Grudgingly he complied. He was a good hunter. She didn't always get the details about how he did something, how he'd saved Aria or stopped a horde of creatures- neither of them could tell her what it was- but it was clear that he was an assett. His parents would've been proud and she told him that. He was as good as Aria, in his own way.

This new generation gave her a sense of hope. They still needed seasoning, more experience, of course. Most of all, they needed to lose their innocent naive view of the world. Again, the idea of the three of them together, as a team, resurfaced. The three of them...four if you counted Aurora- the intel person, couldn't forget her- the four of them, with her in the lead. She smiled at the thought.

That night in the hotel room, she thought about their upcoming hunt. But she also thought about her plans. Nox was the impediment to Aria. But Nox was a prize of his own. She already had some pull with him. It would be good to clear the air with him. Work on their burgeoning friendship. She got up and left her room, tip-toed to his door and knocked. No one answered. She knocked again but nothing. Maybe he was asleep. As she walked back to her room she stopped at Aria's door. Maybe he was there. She stood there for a moment, thinking. Well, tonight wasn't going to be the night. Tomorrow though. Maybe tomorrow.

She went back to her room and stripped down to nothing. She went to the mirror to look at herself. Still tight and firm. No sagging or loose skin on her. Well, maybe a little around the elbow. And there were a few lines around her eyes. But she knew she was still pretty. She turned and looked over her shoulder. Yeah, she still had it. The black dragon tattoo on her lower back had not changed its shape at all despite being 30 years old. She's gotten in while still just a teenager. Regan had gotten the artist to do it despite her being only 15. The lines were still sharp, the black still true. She often wondered what people thought of it when they saw it. Nox probably had seen it when he fixed her wounds since at the other two times they not been in a position for him to see it for long. Didn't matter. It reminded her of Regan. He had loved tracing his fingers in outline of the image. It had branded or marked her as special. She didn't really get it- she'd done it for him really- until after that night Regan died. It was then that she really understood what she was. She was glad it marked her.

She slipped under the cool covers, remembering back to those times with Regan. Memories of Aria's sweet body kept imposing themselves on her though. The feel of her skin, the taste of her lips, the look in her eyes. Jacinda didn't fight the memory and let herself enjoy it. She drifted off to sleep. 

**** Nox ****

Nox tried to sleep in the car, but it didn't work too well.  Aria and Jacinda were telling stories and Jacinda coaxed a few out of him.  Sadly details had to be left out.  They had secrets to keep from this deadly hunter.  He could tell Aria was falling down the rabbit hole again.  Jacinda seemed to coax it out of her with every word she said.  Aria's body language spoke of deadly graceful wolf, but when Jacinda pulled at Aria with the stories, he saw the change, it didn't say anything other than predator.  He shivered when he looked at her.  But he didn't say anything, he just smiled and touched her.  It was part of the game.  Partly knowing that the one touch would mean more than any thing he could have said.  Jacinda wanted to pull Aria one way, he knew how to pull her the other.  It was a game of tug-of-war.  But Jacinda would win without Lucas to guide her.  He could see it, see everything.  But there was little he could do, he was tired, he hurt, his head still pounded.

They stayed in a hotel, three rooms, but he could have only gotten two, he had no intentions of leaving Aria alone.  He sat in the chair while she did her thing, he nursed a beer.  And then she looked at him and told him he needed to sleep.  How the hell did she think she could help with that?  But what the hell.  He laid down on her bed, it wasn't the first time they'd shared a bed, funds got tight, rooms were scarce or some other reason, but everything felt different after seeing Aria with Jacinda.  She laid down, fully clothed and put her hand on his.  It was simple, and he felt her trying to calm him, sending him into a slumber he needed.  His dreams were nothing, like Aria kept them at bay.  It was not the best night sleep he'd had since he'd gotten back to the States, but it was what he needed right then.

Nox heard Aria moving about, she woke up to early, he rolled over and slept until his alarm went off.  He turned over and laid on his back and looked at Aria as she flipped through her wallet.  "Thank you."  He meant it, he had needed it.

Nox stretched and got up out of the bed and grabbed a shower.  Aria made him coffee, she was getting good at it, but he expected it was because he was a grump without it.

Showered, shaved and dressed, he felt much better.  He opened the door to the bathroom and Aria still sat in the same chair.  He bent down and kissed the top of her head.  "Really thank you."

He looked around, "What no breakfast?"

Aria grinned, "We are going to the diner for breakfast, we've rumors to hear."

He nodded.  "Ya'll are probably waiting on me huh?"

She nodded, "Yup.  She's been a wake almost as long as I have."

"Of course she has."  He refrained from rolling his eyes.  "I'll get her."

Nox went to knock on Jacinda's door.  He hoped she was dressed and ready to go.  He knocked and waited.

**** Jacinda ****

Jacinda finished lacing up her boots when she heard a knock at the door. She grabbed her coat and opened the door. It was Nox. He still looked at her with suspicion. She frowned and then went back into her room and sat in a chair. "Let's talk Nox."

Nox followed her in and closed the door.  "Okay.  About what?"  He stood against the door like he was ready to flee.

She smiled. Yeah, he was upset and on the offensive. She sighed. "Look, I know Aria's like your sister. I know you feel protective of her. I'm not trying to hurt her." It was tough to do this with him standing way over there. "Will you sit down already? This isn't a battle you know. We're on the same side."

Nox sat down on the edge of the bed with a grumble.  "You don't know what you do when you talk to Aria like that.  You have no clue what you do to her."

Jacinda raised an eyebrow curiously. She wanted to probe. But Nox was emotional. The wall could go up at any moment. Once that was up, it would be over, at least for now. And she wanted there to be peace. More than that, she wanted understanding between them.

"I know that I do not have Aria's abilities. I know that." She shook her head and sighed. "I have to scope out a scene for hours before I can start to get a feel for how the creature saw things, before I can get a sense of where it came from or went. Aria gets it instantly. I know there's more to her than just Furia. At least, from what I know of Furia. She sees things I would have seen- the way the creatures think. I'd almost say she was Sentient, if I didn't know that was impossible." She laughed. "That has to make her more vulnerable to things. But there's something you don't get Nox." She looked at him and spoke from her heart. "Regardless of how, I had the same struggle she did. You weren't even born. This was before I even knew your parents. I was good Nox. My partner, Regan, he trained me. But I had a sense about things. I got into their head. I don't know if you know about profilers. I could get into the heads of these things. It scared me because I could imagine being them. I even understood their hungers, their desires." She shook her head, remember how that scared her, the way Regan comforted her. "I found that darkness in myself all too easily."

She looked at Nox and let him see her fully, her openness. "I understand what Aria is going through because I went through it too." She looked down and then back at him. "But I learned something. As long as I fought it, it had too much power over me. It wanted to come out in terrible ways. I had some horrible fantasies Nox. Things I won't tell anyone, even now, decades later. By repressing it, by fighting it, I had no control over it." She put her hand on hers. "When I let go *during* the fight, when I let it engulf me *while* I was fighting evil, I purged myself. It came out in a good way, protecting humanity." She smiled, trying to convey to him the relief that she'd felt after that first night, the night Regan had been killed and she gave in. "God, Nox, when I let go, I fought better than I ever had in my life. I was a machine and the rougs, they died terrifed. Which was right. They tortured us, fed on us, viewed us as weak animals. But that night, I was the thing of their nightmares. You have to know what that felt like. You know what they do. But when I was done, when it was over and I had buried Regan and continued on my own, my own struggles had ended. I could profile a creature, could get in its head, could do it all. But there were no fantasies. No nightmares. Nothing. Once I embraced it, I got control."

She looked at Nox, quietly breathing. "As long as a person fights the darkness it comes out in other ways. But if you embrace it, you gain control. I wanted Aria to understand that.  You should understand that too, Nox. You! You are a great hunter. I can tell just from the things I've seen of you." She smiled. "Can you imagine the three of us? What we could do?" She laughed. "Makes me laugh just seeing the rougs or oni's shitting themselves at know that we were coming for them."

**** Nox ****

Nox listened to her tale.  He understood to a degree, but he knew things Jacinda didn't, she suspected though.  Nox wondered what she would do if she found out Aria was Sentient.  But it wasn't his secret to tell and he wouldn't let her know, not like this anyway.

He spoke out loud, but it was his thoughts he wasn't sure how much sense he'd make.  "See it's not the problem.  It's the after that's the problem.  She embraces the darkness.  She can't come back from it.  The first time it happened, I didn't know her.  But she's told me what it was like.  Everything inside her was dead.  She didn't care anymore.  She sat with a gun on her knees contemplating killing herself.  It wasn't until a bad confrontation with her ..."  How does one put Dane in to perspective, "her friend that guided her to the path she's on now that she found anger, felt something.  That's when she met Lucas.  You don't like Lucas I get that, you think it makes her weak.  It doesn't.  Aria embraces all parts of herself.  Her only problem is that she believes she's not worthy of anything.  You could be her heaven and earth with a drop of a hat.  You could guide her, instead of tempt her into the darkness.  The darkness will kill her, it will kill you.  And it'll kill anyone who touches her.  Aria was a great hunter before the darkness took over, she's intelligent and stronger than you'll ever know.  But she doubts everything about herself.  She doesn't need the darkness to be great, she is great.  She is who she is and I love her for it.  She doesn't care if you have a dark past, doesn't care if you been an all around good person, her life is built to save people.  It's all she knows, but that darkness, it will kill those people she wants to save.  I've followed her when she went out without me.  She pulled herself back from the moments she wanted to kill a girl, for no other reason than she could.  The girl to my knowledge was not a monster, just a girl who wouldn't be missed.  Aria is not the sanest of people.  She doesn't need to be to do what she does.  I'm not going to tell you not to talk to Aria, not to try to get through to her, but I think you are doing it the wrong way."

**** Jacinda ****

Jacinda listened. She wasn't a fool. What Nox described was more than what he struggled with. Then again, she'd already known that. If Jacinda had her struggle just from her own abitlity to have an almost intuitive empathy then how much more so a girl like Aria.

But Nox was wrong. Everything he described about Aria was a darker shadow of what Jacinda had struggled with. The fantasies she'd had were very similar to what he described in Aria. Lack of opportunity or something else kept her from acting on it. But she'd wanted to. And who knew? After 10 years of repression, when she was Aria's age, she may very well have also killed a girl who no one would have missed just because she'd wanted to. He didn't get it. Aria was just like her. More vulnerable because of her abilities, the hungers darker. But just like her.

She sighed. "There are two ways. Repression and acceptance with an outlet. I think Aria is stronger than you think. Not enough to withstand the repression. You and Lucas and Aurora can be there all you like, try to keep her from going there, but the desire will build. Eventually, all that pressure is going to come out. Explosively. It's simple physics, Nox." She smiled weakly. She wished he'd understand. "I'm saying that *if* she can let off her steam- embrace that darkness during the hunt- the fight- then she will be able to live with that pressure. It will never take control of her." She remembered back to the face she'd seen on Aria when Nox took her, when they had been fucking. It was animal. But it made sense. All this repression, all this pressure, all these rules hemming her in- and then to stop her when she was in the middle of blowing off steam, when they are in the middle of pleasuring each other- what the fuck did he expect? But he couldn't hear that. "Just think about it. Think about how *long* it had been since Aria had let out some of the pressure. Think about it building in her. And then you can decide whether you think its better for her to do it your way or mine. My way may have her crazy for a little while. But she'll come out it. You showed that, if nothing else. I know you knocked her out. It wasn't a bad decision. And how is she today? The pressure is gone. She let it out just a little bit and it helped. Just think about that."

She got up and went to the door. "We better go and see what our first plan of action is." She paused, thinking. Nox was wound pretty tight too. "You might think about that for yourself too, Nox. You don't have to be Furia or Sentient to struggle. Trust me, I know. Pressure builds in all of us." She smiled at him and walked out.

****  Nox ****

Maybe she was right, but if she were wrong, the world would pay.  Nox let it go, didn't say anything, he'd think about it.  She paused to say he might be wound too tight, she had no clue what the hell was going on with him.  Yeah he knew about his own dark places.  But he wasn't wound tightly, he had his outlets.  He grinned as he new she was one of those outlets the last couple times.  

Jacinda left to find the plan, Nox stood up and followed behind her.  "Aria says we are having breakfast at the diner around the corner.  She's looking for the rumors while we eat I guess."  

Aria stood against the wall waiting, she smiled at them, it was her you took long enough smile.  Nox grinned at her.  "I'm starving."  He put his arm around Jacinda's shoulder and one around Aria's.  He felt better, alot better now that he'd some sleep.  His mind still reeled from the images in his dreams and in reality but he could at least fake it most of the time now.

**** Aria ****

Nox was feeling better, or at least putting on a good face.  He was tired, confused and a mixed bag of emotions on the inside, but he was Nox on the outside.  It was good to see him being 'happy' again even though Aria knew the truth of it all.  There probably wasn't much she could do to help either.  She had a big feeling she was part of the problem.  It made her sad.  But they'd get through it, it's what they did afterall.

The diner was around the corner, almost literally.  They walked with Nox in between hanging on them with a stupid grin.  He was on top of the world to everyone on the outside.  Inside the diner was quaint.  A typical dinner, at the counter a few locals sat, a family in the booth by the bathroom.  They sat near the entrance, mostly because it was in the center and could easily hear most of the mining area, they were after rumors after all.  Weird things don't happen in small towns without everyone talking about it.  Even in big cities it happened, but it wasn't really more than that, rumors.  In a small town like this, well, it was people they knew, the tones were quiet, the implications large.  They had to tread lightly on this one.

The waitress came to the table, she was pretty, if you liked the girl next door type, she was dressed in the god-awful diner uniform, which I'm sure looks great on the models, but for normal girls not so much.  She had her brown hair pulled back into a braid, her little white apron had drying coffee stains on it.  Accidents happen Aria supposed.  She hoped it wasn't her fault.  

She handed them the menus and Nox brushed her hand against hers.  He was really putting on a good happy show for the world.  His heart wasn't in it, not really.  But no one would notice.  "Duckling, can you please bring me and my friend here a pot of coffee, and keep it full."  Nox nodded to Aria with a grin, "She'll have a water."

Aria nodded, "What he said."  She left with a smile and Aria kicked Nox under the table.  "We can order our own food."

He laughed and patted her hand.  "I know.  Women and their femenism."  He grinned in playfulness.  While he felt all mixed up inside, Aria knew he was doing his best to not be that way.  She smiled at him.  He was trying.  

The waitress came back with their drinks, Nox let her pour the first cup of coffee but he was pouring a second before the orders were even taken.  Aria ordered a simple breakfast, eggs, bacon and some toast.  Nox ordered about half the menu before he drowned another cup of coffee.  He had to be burning his mouth with its heat, but he didn't seam to care. Which Aria thought was not a good thing.  Aria wondered what they'd talked about, he probably wondered what her and Jacinda had talked about too.  They probably needed to sit down and talk about it all.

As their food arrived a woman came in, she looked exasperated, she was not hysterical, but she felt like someone who thought she was going crazy.  Aria watched the woman as she sat down at the counter and ordered coffee and pie.  Pie first thing in the morning, suppose it was a comfort food.  

Their waitress stopped in front of the woman and patted her hand.  "Chris having issues again?"

The woman nodded as she took a sip of her hot coffee.  It was hot enough that she set it back down and put her hand to her lips as if it would cool it down.  Aria looked to Nox and wondered if he had cooled his coffee down.  She hadn't noticed him going into emptiness, but maybe he was doing it quickly.  Aria sighed to herself, his and Aurora's power was still new to them all.  And the two were completely different from each other, Aurora would understand one thing and Nox would counter it with the opposite, yet both clearly worked.  It was a mystery, much like this little adventure.

The woman shook as if she were crying.  She sat there with tears soaking her pie.  Aria smiled at Nox.  "Nox, dear, I think the woman at the counter is someone you should talk to."

**** Nox ****

Nox flirted with the waitress, but he wasn't really feeling it.  But she was cute, though she was probably in a relationship or had some kid or another working in a diner like this.  Though if you are down and out you took what you could get, Aurora worked a shit hole like this for a few weeks once after their Dad passed.  It was short lived, and just enough to pay for the stupid motel that they had been staying in.  It wasn't long until the Atharim pay checks rolled in, they got the money instead of good ol' dad.  Maybe he'd have not drank as much if they'd had their own money they earned.  But it went into his pockets and he used it.  

Aria was watching the crowd, he wondered what she was reading off of them.  If it had been the two of them they'd have their heads together whispering, looking like a couple keeping secrets. He laughed inside at that, how wrong appearances were.

Aria implied someone was a suspect, or at least was someone worth talking to.  The woman was about Jacinda's age, but she was hardly Jacinda.  She looked like she'd popped out a kid or three, her wedding band was sparkling away on her hand.  But she looked tired, looked like she was going to break down right there.  He trusted Aria.  He poured another cup of coffee and slide out of the booth.

Nox put on his best smile and sat down next to the woman.  He nodded to her when she looked at him.  She smiled weakly back.  "You look like you know what's good on the menu?  I'll have what she's having."  The waitress frowed at him and Nox gave her a wink.  She placed a plate of peach pie in front of him.  Really, it had to be peach.  He'd have to actually look next time.  He took a bite.  "Are you alright, Duckling?"  He picked up her chin and wiped a tear away.  "A pretty girl like you shouldn't be crying.  And if it's over a man, point him out.  I'll teach him a thing or two."

The woman pulled away from him.  "No I'm alright.  My husband...he's just been having strange things happen to him.  And now, he's lying at home dying and I don't know what to do."

"Husband, ah, I see."  He sounded disappointed, he was hoping for more information though.  "Strange things?"

She nodded, "You wouldn't believe me if I told you."

Nox grinned.  "Try me, I bet there isn't anything you can say that I haven't heard already."

She looked at him with eyes as big as saucers, she was shocked to hear that.  Nox nodded, "Trust me."  He put his hand on hers.  He hoped she'd trust him.

She leaned in.  "You really wouldn't believe me.  My son fell out of our second story window, I could have sworn he was going to fall on to the rod iron gates, you know those ones with the sharp arrow points at the top.  But he didn't, it was like a gust of wind pushed him out of the way.  My husband said it was nothing, nothing but the wind.  But then there was this fire, an explosion, and my husband escaped while no one else did.  He's been sick so much lately."

Nox knew exactly what was happening.  However he didn't exactly want to relay the message to Jacinda.  He'd have to tell Aria later, at least the who, he'd give them both the weirdness.

Nox nodded to the woman, he stood up and walked behind her and whispered in her ear.  "I beleive you.  I'd like to meet your husband sometime soon."  Nox slipped the woman a slip of paper he'd jotted down his number on.  "Call me if the weird happens again."

Nox slide back into the booth.  "She's seen weird things happen first hand.  Wind blowing kids away from fences, a fire only one person has survived.  Sounds like we've a godling in our midst, somewhere."

Nox was anxious, he had practiced not showing it to people but he knew Aria knew.  He wondered if Jacinda's extended empathy for monsters went for goldings too.  He was starting to get worried, what if she found out his secret.  It was bad enough she suspected Aria was more than Furia, but he was a godling.  He was what the Atharim really fought against.  

**** Jacinda ****

The morning had been uneventful. Nox had gone for affability- draping an arm on both of them as if they were his girls. He very nearly got a broken rib as a nice reminder of who Jacinda was. She wasn't anyone's girl. Regan had been the last to call her that and that was 25 years ago. Idly, she wondered if she'd still feel that way now, had he lived. He was about 30 years older than her. That would put him in his 70s. He'd not be out on missions that's for sure. And while his being in his 40s when he'd first taken her had been ok with her then, she wasn't sure that liver-spotted hands and atrophied muscle and thinning hair would have appealed to her now. Then again, if he had lived, they would've spent it together and that might not have bothered her at all.

That he might have ditched her for another teenage girl didn't occur to her. At least not consciously. But when she thought about it, on the main she liked the younger guys. Not only because they were physically more appealing but also because it gave her a sense of power. There was never any question of who was dominant in their relationship. Indeed, that element of the power imbalance made things that much better. Had Regan lived, that might have complicated things. In the end, he, like her parents, had not been good enough, strong enough, or fast enough. It was she, the young girl, who'd not only survived, but had exacted vengeance on the rougs that had orphaned her for a third time. And it was her who had gone on to continue the hunt for the next 30 years. She was stronger even than Regan had been. It was something to think about.

They got to the diner and hunkered down. She ordered chicken fried steak and eggs, a side of pancakes and coffee. The last few days had been taxing, phsyically and emotionally. Stick to your ribs food was what she craved. What did interest her, though, was Aria's reading of the restaurant. Jacinda watched her carefully. She'd read the literature on Furia and had always thought it was heavily dependent on smells- more specifically pheremones- in the room. Aria's technique didn't seem to be dependent on that. At least, the diner was filled with the smells of food and coffee. She couldn't tell if the waitress wore perfume, though very likely not. You don't put on one of those unflattering uniforms and a coffee-stained apron and then perfume as if you are trying to attract a guy. Point being, how Aria could sift through the crowded restaurant and pinpoint someone for Nox to check out was a mystery.

More and more, she suspected Aria was not a Furia at all. It fit, actually. If she was a Sentient, then her...darkness- her struggle- took on an added dimension. It didn't change what Jacinda said or what she felt- the things she told Nox had been the simple truth. People like them- her, Aria and even Nox himself- needed an outlet or else they would explode in uncontrolled ways.

Strangley, realizing that Aria was likely Sentient did not send her into the "other" category- the monsters who needed to be put down. She'd already developed an understanding of Furia- a trait that allowed one to tell what people were dangerous and had done violence likely based on a host of subconcious indicators. She had her own version of special abilities that she knew came from training and natural instinct and skill. Furia were just another level of that. And from what she'd seen of Aria, she was prepared to believe the same thing. Of course, any skill that was perverted in its use- used for evil or something like that- could condemn a person to death in her eyes. But fundementally, Aria was still human. She didn't think she was a wolf or anything. She didn't touch power that would drive her mad and lead to the death of others like the godlings she'd put down.

She decided to be blunt. "You're not Furia are you? Sentient right?"

**** Aria ****

Aria didn't watch Nox as he left to go tend to the woman's story.  But she never stopped listening to the emotions going through her, she could track the woman anywhere she want in the small town now.  She could follow her and find her as long as she didn't get on something moving fast, and had many stops, etc.  A car was easy to track, but mass transpotation not so much.  

Aria poked at her food mostly, not extremely hungry.  But she nearly choked on the piece of bacon when Jacinda asked her if she was Sentient.  Aria looked up from her plate to see where Nox was, he was fine, but Aria now had a situation she'd rather not have.  

"And if I am?"  Aria looked back down at her plate and took a bite of her eggs.  All appeitite was gone now.  But she'd at least act like she didn't care one way or the other.

Jacinda smiled amused. "It's alright sweetheart. I understand. You just are far too good to simply be Furia." She paused, as if unsure to go on. "I believe in what we do. But from what I've seen, you are Atharim to the core."

Aria relaxed for now, but she wasn't going to let up all that much on this, Jacinda could easily take her and Nox, if Nox was not going to use his power and out himself.  It better not go badly.  Aria looked up.  "I was trained to be Furia.  My files all say Furia.  I didn't know I wasn't Furia until a few months back."  Aria laughed.  "Went to Vactican City, where I grew up, to retreive a book in their archives.  But what I found wasn't just that book, found a whole lot more."  Aria wasn't going to mention seeing the Regus, and her mission.  That was the last thing she wanted anyone to know, particularly in a country that disliked the CCD as a whole.  

"My mentor, who apparently enjoyed lying to me my whole life, not just about what I was, but who he was.  He threw me under the bus.  Eventually I'm sure the secret won't be quite so secret anymore."

Jacinda listened, saying little, though nodding at times. When Aria was done, she didn't say anything at first. Instead she had a slight smile and then shook her head. "Talk about darkness huh. I get it hun, I do." She reached out a hand and touched Aria's. "The struggle is never ending. It's never going to stop. I hope you take my advice. I may not be Sentient or Furia but I know what it's like to want to make the world pay. It's made me stronger of course. But that darkness is still inside me. If I deny it or repress it it only gets stronger. So I've learned to live with it, to let it out when *I* choose to. *I* am in control." She smiled. "Life it a brutal contest Aria. Kill or be killed. That's it. You and I- and even Nox there- we are all in this contest. Our enemies are the most vile and powerful creatures imaginable. And yet everyday, we fight them and we win." Her smile became a wide grin. "We win Aria. You are strong enough to do this. I believe you can. I don't think the darkness will consume you." She shrugged and took her hand away. "Simple as that. I think that you will win this- if you let me help you." She looked over and saw Nox coming this way. She fell silent and waited for him to sit and report.

There was much to think about what Jacinda said, but Aria was glad for Nox's interruption.  It meant work and work was always more enjoyable than the fluffy talk about her emotions.  It was one thing to talk with Lucas about it.  But Jacinda was a relative stranger, like or not was not a question.  Aria had enough emotions to go around she didn't like talking about the way she felt.  And her darkness was her own personal struggle.  

Aria knew Nox was keeping something from them.  And once he mentioned godlings, she had an idea what might be the issue.  The woman had revealed more than Nox was telling, she was sure of that.

"Any indications of where the strange things happened?"  Aria asked, Nox looked rather ashamed, he'd forgotten to ask.  Aria grinned at him.  

The waitress happened to be picking up some empty plates at the near by table and stopped with a smile.  "I don't mean to interrupt, but those strange things are happening all over the place.  The Keen house, out just past the interstate was an explosion for no reason.  And Howe's Cavern has been seeing some weird things happening too.  No one knows what's going on.  A few months back there was an incident back at Old Mr. Kray's house, he said that he saw a ghost, his dead wife came to him.  But I don't think it was her, even as a ghost, he was dilerious before that.  The woman you were talking to, that's her father.  But he's fine now, no more dementia."  The waitress shrugged.  "I don't know why you'd want to know about the weird things here."

Aria smiled.  "Thanks.  Can you tell us where the last incident was?"

The waitress nodded, "The fire out by the interstate.  It's a contruction site.  Well it was."

"Appreciate it."

**** Nox ****

The waitress gave them some good intel, Nox would have to tip her well.  Not that he would have done otherwise.  She kept his coffee full.  And that was almost as important as the intel.

Aria did look better today, but she'd talked to Lucas last night, for a good while.  He hadn't paid much attention.  He was starting to doubt his knowledge of things, maybe Jacinda was right.  But that wasn't for now, he needed to talk to Aria, alone, but that didn't look likely to happen.  They had looked like they were sharing another moment.  He wondered about what.

Nox finished what he'd ordered, he was still rather hungry, he wasn't exactly sure why, maybe it was nerves, maybe just too much pent up energy.  But he didn't think there was going to be a fight in this round.  Neither he nor Aria wanted to kill this man.  He hadn't done anything bad.  Nox wished Aurora's intel had been a little more in depth, and that Jacinda hadn't been there, or here now.  The man just needed to learn what he was so he stopped using it without knowing.  The sickness was going to kill him, and from the way his wife reacted, it seemed pretty bad now.  He remembered that day he got sick, before he could control it.  It was horrible.  He shuddered.

Aria took the lead, she pushed him out of the booth.  Nox drained the last of his coffee and dropped the last of his American cash on the table.  It wasn't much, it was credits from here on out.  Thankfully they were almost done, and hopefully not too many more cash transactions needed to be taken care of.

Aria paid the bill at the counter. He'd yet to see Jacinda fork out any money willingly, she'd paid sure, he thought she had anyway, but he or Aria seemed to catch most of it.  He didn't mind, not really.  It all came from the same place.  And in another week more would magically appear in his account, and he'd fork over his rent automatically and pay the other bills and then the rest was his, in Moscow expenses were easy, credit was easy with the Atharim issued accounts he had now.  Just had to do the paperwork.  He'd let Aria do that, she was used to it, he hated it.  Aurora ended up doing his.  But he almost always made sure she took care of things anyway.  

Jacinda headed out to the Jeep.  "Jacinda."  He tossed her the keys as she turned around.  

He followed Aria to the counter.  He stood behind her and spoke softly.  "I know who the godling is, don't find the trail."

Aria turned around and looked up at him, those piercing green eyes showed her concern for the lies they were about to tell.  Or maybe it was something else.  

She didn't smile.  "She knows."

Now he was concerned, there was alot of things she and knows could mean.  She put her hand on his arm and turned him towards the door.  Nox followed instructions well.  Aria continued, "She knows what I am."

He grinned, "I knew she suspected.  You are still here, that's good.  We stick together Aria, always.  No more splitting up."

Aria nodded and they walked out to the Jeep.  Aria got in the back seat leaving him the shot gun position.  Jacinda drove them out to the construction site.  There really wasn't much left of it.  It was pretty much a burnt shell of a building now.  Nox wondered what it was going to be.  Nothing but ash now more than likely.

They walked around.  He wasn't sure if Aria could track the man from here.  If it was an accident, then he wasn't sure what they'd find.  A godling was not the same as a monster, and untrained ones were worse, they didn't have motive, or emotions other than fear and worry.  They didn't know what they were doing.  Maybe Aria wouldn't even be able to track the guy.

**** Jacinda ****

Jacinda felt a thrill run through her but she said nothing as she listened. A godling. Now that was a hunt. Human in every way possible- even family- but touching power no one should touch. Power that had destroyed the world many times over. She'd learned about them over the years, the lore of the gods and the way they had enslaved humanity. It had truly been survival of the fittest. And that humanity, despite having none of that power, had been able to defeat them said it all. And Jacinda would do whatever was necessary to keep things that way. Otherwise, humanity was done.

She'd taken out maybe a dozen over the last 20 years. Most of the time the kills had been fairly easy. Teenage godling didn't have too much control over their power, after all. But there were a handful that had taken all her skill to track and take down. More dangerous than oni or rakshasa or even draikana. Her foot twinged in memory of the burns. Godlings could call fire and lightning down from the heavens. Or whips of air. Explode the ground in front of you. Their senses were on a par with wolfkin. Those had been the most challenging hunts of her life.

One godling- a 21 year old female- had taken 3 days to hunt. She had power, no question. That was where Jacinda had gotten burned. And one of the blasts had broken her arm. The girl was strong. But still on 17. That had proved to be the advantage she had. All that power and the girl had to sleep. She'd never learned how to sleep and still keep watch. She didn't know where to hide. After that first run in, Jacinda just had to stalk her and run her to ground. She smiled at the memory. In the end, all her vaunted power hadn't stopped the blade of her knife. She hadn't tormented the thing for some reason, though. 

She was interested in seeing how a sentient could track a godling though. That would be something to see. So she watched Aria as they explored the location of the last incident.

**** Aria ****

The construction site was empty, devoid of any persons, even the equipment had been abadonded, it was the middle of the working day, and no one was here.  Aria walked around the site but she couldn't get any real.  There was a lot of fear, and a lot of death, with a mass explosion like that it was hard to pin point much of anything at all, especially when she had nothing to go on.  There was no malice anywhere, it had been an accident, an uninentional use of the power he or she had wielded.

There were no tracks except that they were everywhere, but that's what happens when you have emergency responders everywhere, cops and firemen and probably a ton of civilians too.  There was nothing to track.  She could track any emotion, she could latch on to one, and follow it, but it probably wasn't the right one.  They would have to do this the traditional way.  At least from this site, maybe at the place where the kid had fallen, she could get something, it had less people involved.

Aria walked around but there was nothing.  She shook her head.  "I can't pin point anything.  There is too much, there was no malice involved, nothing to say the trails I can find are the right one.  Maybe at another location.  Too much death, too many afraid."  Aria looked at Jacinda to explain.  "I can't sense a godling when they hold their power.  They disappear, so unless they didn't plan to do this until they held the power, there is nothing for me to follow.  Godlings aren't like normal monsters, not the young ones anyway, or the ones who don't know what they are doing."

Aria hoped that Jacinda didn't ask about how she knew things, she had no channelers to her name, she didn't have any attempts either.  The only saving grace was she could say she was researching to kill Ascendancy, but that was one man she did not want to go up against, it wasn't a challeenge, it meant her life, and her life meant more to her than the day she'd accepted the job, and she'd only accepted it to insure she lived a little while longer.  It was ironic really.  But she would drop that card if she had to.  She wasn't about to give up any of the men and women she'd met who could wield the power of the gods, not even Dane.  The darkness flitted into being at the thought of his name, she surpressed it to the best of her ability, but the darkness was too close, to raw, she hadn't completely healed from the other night.  Aria closed her eyes and focused on Nox, he was the only calming thing around, there was too much death, and too much fear, the darkness wanted to envelope it all, to feel it all.

****  Jacinda ****

Aria walked around for a while looking like she was searching for something. After some time she shook her head and said that she couldn't find anything. Part of Jacinda wanted to think on what she was learning about Aria's abilities. You needed to know how something worked- what it could and couldn't do- before you could know when to use it. And the same thing went with people and their skills. Tracking a godling would be hard even with a Sentient as the tracker. The fact that they couldn't be sensed when they held their power was filed away too.

But all this really meant was that they were going to have to do this the old-fashioned way. Not really old-fashioned, since up until a few days ago, it was still the *only* way to do it. She was surprised, though, at how quickly outmoded that method seemed when you had a Furia or Sentient to work with. She shook her head. Atharim were slow to make changes, but this one was one that needed to be implemented now. Not *in place of* the old ways. *In addition to* rather. A team with someone like Aria would be very effective. Idly, she had a vision of her team- her, Aria and Nox- paving the way. See what they could do then. She smiled to herself.

"Well then, I guess we do this the old-fashioned way," using the word she had been thinking of. "We have a few possibilities. One, the godling destroyed this site for some reason. Maybe to hide something." The stories of the gods were in the back of her mind. "Or just because they wanted to cause destruction." She looked at Aria. "You said that you can't sense anything when they're holding the power. I assume that means that if they were holding the power the whole time, they would not leave a trail of....intent I guess is the best word, for you to follow right?" Aria nodded.

"So, that's option one. Two, It was an accident. I don't know if you both have hunting godlings before but accidents are pretty common with them. It's almost like they can't control themselves at first. This very easily could have been an accident. In which case, the surviver would be the obvious godling." She paused. "Option three was that this was simply an accident of the normal sort. And option four is that this was foul play of the normal sort."

She looked at both of them. "Option four doesn't seem as likely because Aria doesn't sense any intent. The culprate wouldn't know we had someone who could track them. And in most cases, they'd stay behind to make sure the destruction happened. So we can rule that out." After a nod from both of them, she went on. "That leaves three options. One of them will depend on the fire-marshall's investigation. Those could take some time." She smiled. Very easily it had settled on the two options that really amounted to one. A godling to hunt. "That leaves us with a godling knowingly or unknowingly destroying this place. So...we check the survivor out. And we check out the other two incidents and see if there's a connection." She looked at Aria for a moment, trying to decide something. Splitting up didn't seem like it was necessary. And if the survivor was a godling they'd all be needed.

Nox had an irritated look on his face and she mentally rolled her eyes. But if this was going to be her team, they both needed to feel like they were contributing. She knew she could be overbearing. Normally she didn't care. But she really did want to keep this going. She was going to have to be nicer. "Habits, Nox. Just habits. I'm used to doing this alone or having point. And I have been a hunter for longer than you've been alive." She gave him a smile. "But I know I'm not the only one here. What do you think?" She looked at Aria. "Both of you. Let's decide together."

**** Nox ****

Nox tried very hard not to laugh at their experience hunting godlings.  Hunting them they had absolutely zero experience, but they had first hand knowledge.  He was a godling, Aria has a handful of acquaintances that were godlings, she had been saved by one on her first mission in Moscow.  And every kill she had involved a godling in some form or another.  He wondered how Aria was going to play the experience off.  She did have her name still attached to one little godling suspect.  He sighed, Dane Gregory, a man who used his power in a police station suspected of kidnapping a girl, but no proof allowed him to get out and then he flew off to Mexico, it was probably a good thing Aria didn't want to see him again.  He was too close for comfort.  The man that had caused the whole Aria problems to begin with.  Though she didn't blame him, Nox did, he was pretty sure Lucas would too if he ever found out.

Jacinda rattled on about things, options.  He didn't know why but he just felt annoyed that she assumed the lead, it was annoying.  But then she asked for his input, and Aria's.  Though it only made things slightly better that she'd sort apologized, he let it drop.  He tried to be more like Aria, more accepting of things. Though he hoped she'd at least stop a good share of that, it was her biggest problem.  

Though he didn't have much to add.  He knew exactly where they should start, what they needed to do.  But he didn't want to kill the man, he'd only accidentally harmed those people, he was sure of it.  "Given that it's likely an accident, the survivor is likely our best bet.  But we probably don't want to go up and just knock either.  He's capable of producing fire, and god knows what else."  Nox was slightly concerned about meeting another male godling, he knew from Bas and Pytor that they could sense the power when he held it.  It would put a damper on things if the man lashed out because of that presense.  That presence was the reason he remembered he had power, if Giovanni hadn't tried to show off he'd never have remembered, never have run into Aria, or Bas and Pytor for that matter.  

"Do we have the name of the survivor?"  He hated doing it, but he couldn't not do it either.  The situation was too precarious.

**** Aria ****

Jacinda was right, but Nox was nervous, and Aria didn't want to have to kill a man who wasn't trying to hurt people.  It was all so weird, this was her first godling hunt.  Commander Vellas had saved her from a rougarou.  Giovanni and Jensen had helped her kill an Ijiraq.  Tehya was an Atharim.  And then there was Dane.  She'd wanted to kill him that night, but that wasn't a hunt, it was purely about killing him, and the reporter.  But she'd never had to hunt one, well not really hunt them.  Sure she was hunting Ascendancy but she knew exactly where he was, it was just a matter of getting close enough to kill him.  And that didn't ever seem possible, much less she didn't want to either.  It meant her life in the end, either Ascendancy would kill her or the Regus would if she failed.

It seemed they were going into research mode.  "I don't recall the names off hand.  But I'm sure Aurora has it all laid out plain as day."

Aria smiled.  "I have the information with me."  She looked around.  "But I don't think this is the place we should be scouring information.  Someplace more comfortable, and more private."  

Jacinda listened and then said, "I guess we can go back to the hotel. That's private enough I think."

Aria nodded and Nox followed suit, Aria got the feeling he wasn't overly happy still, even though Jacinda was trying to include him in decision making.  Which said a lot about her at least she was trying.  Nox was just being difficult, he was like that with his sister.

The ride back to the motel was quiet, Aria flipped through the infomation on her wallet.  Aurora was through, and the information was there they just had to sift through the news reports.

Nox knew who they were after, but he hadn't said anything yet, not to her and she knew why not to Jacinda.  They walked a fine line here.  It could go badly quickly in so many ways.

It wasn't long until they were getting out of the Jeep and walking into Jacinda's room.  Nox glanced at Aria, she knew he was not happy about this hunt, she was pretty sure he was doubting inviting her along.  But then again she'd probably have just come along anyway, though without the invitation she'd have had to follow them.  It could have save alot of issues in the long run, but it was what it was.

Aria sat down on the floor and put her wallet in holo mode and flung the reports up to the views.  "These are the incidences themselves.  The explosion however didn't release the name of the survivor.  And the rag magazines about the flying kid aren't overly helpful.  We probably need to dig into the police database or find follow up reports on this."

The day passed, and they hadn't found much to go on.  Nox had gotten them lunch at the diner, he'd brought enough food so they hadn't had to leave when they got hungry again.  But with three heads going the information just wasn't public knowledge.  There was no medical report on the boy, no police report either.  And the name for the survivor of the explosion had not been released probably due to the small town nature of things, everyone already knew.  They didn't have connections like they did in Moscow or any of the CCD or the 'old world'.  

It was getting late and Aria needed to call Lucas.  Nox joined her when she left.  He said something about sleeping.  He had no intentions of leaving her alone, he'd made it clear last night, he just didn't trust Jacinda not to stop over.  She didn't blame him, not really.  

Nox sat down in the chair and watched her, Aria could feel his anxiety and his other emotions rise.  She could have asked what was bothering him, but she was pretty sure he wouldn't really tell her anyway.  Aria sat on the bed and called Lucas.  He grinned at her and Aria nodded, she'd be fine, he left the room and Aria blocked everything out except Lucas' voice.

**** Nox ****

Nox didn't like this, he hated lying to Aria.  But he hadn't been able to tell her what he knew, and she never explicitly asked him either, they were keeping secrets, and if Jacinda found out that could be a problem.

He busied himself with trying to look for information.  It wasn't his thing, he could play to that for a while, so he decided to get lunch, and he brought back too much food.  He didn't have the oppurtunity to go again for dinner.  But he did have a chance be away from the two women.  Being alone was good, but the moment he was back in their midst, he was at odds again.  

And it didn't help that images of the past few days kept playing in his head.  Sleep had helped, Aria had helped, but still the images didn't leave.  

The day drew on and Aria wanted to call Lucas.  He went with her, made sure she did what she said she was going to do.  Not that she ever lied to him, or to Lucas.  She was funny that way, the lies she kept, kept other safe for the most part.

Nox didn't really want to be in the same room with Aria as she spoke with Lucas, it could sometimes get awkward, him being there.  And knowing was part of the problem.  The images that had seared they way into his head only made those matters worse.  There really was only one thing to do about it, and he couldn't exactly do that with Aria however much those images screamed at him to do so.  It would be easy to seduce her, he knew exactly how to do it.  He choose not to repeatedly.

He got up with a grin at Aria, she had to know what he was feeling, maybe not why, but she knew.  

He knocked on Jacinda's door.

**** Jacinda ****

The research was long and boring and bore little fruit. Hunts were like that, though. You had to plow through all the boring mundane stuff, sniffing out clues and facts and piece together a trail or suspect or location. Couldn't all be highs, after all. Or rather, the highs seemed high only because of the time you spent on the boring stuff. The adrenaline rush of chasing down a chupe or oni was heightened because you had to spend the time figuring out where to look. So while she was bored, she also slogged through it with Aria and Nox without complaint.

Nox got them some food from the diner and they ate while they worked. By nightfall, they still had nothing yet. After the last week of driving, of hunts and playing, they were all kind of tired. Not enough to want a vacation or something. But taking a day or two to track their godling wouldn't hurt. They weren't oni or chupes. They generally weren't out killing or feeding on people. They were a more subtle threat. Most of the time, they didn't even know how much of a danger they were yet. So they had time and when Aria and Nox decided to bail, she was ok with it. She was probably going to kick back in her bed and watch tv or something. Pull up a series she followed and binge on a few episodes. The back of her mind would continue to work on the case. Usually she'd get a few flashes of insight during her down time.

She stripped down to a large shirt and her panties and got into bed. The sheets were smooth and cool. She propped the pillows up and settled back to watch the X-Files. It was a reimagined series from maybe 10 or 20 years ago. She'd never seen the original. It was entertaining, given the similarities to her job. Unrealistic in a lot of things, but she didn't need anything heavy or smart. It was fun. Plus the guy who played Mulder was hot.

There was a knock at the door and Jacinda went and opened it. Nox stood in front of her, a curious look in his eyes. He didn't say anything. "Yes?" She waited.

**** Nox ****

He hadn't expected her to answer in much, he was glad she hadn't.  Not that he needed much to want to be with her right then, his own memories and other images were plenty.  She looked mildy annoyed, but he didn't really care.  He put a hand behind her head and kissed her deeply.

She was startled for a moment and pulled back. Then, with a bit of a shrug, she kissed him back just as hard. Not the animal frenzy of before. But still with force.

He pushed her back a few steps and kicked the door closed behind him.  Nox took her wrist and turned her towards the wall and pushed her up against it and kissed her.  He knew the type of woman she was, their first night had declared her need to make this a fight, but he didn't want to fight.  He just wanted to do this, to make everything dim down at least for now.  He wasn't overly gentle with kissing her, he had to be careful that he paid attention, but he would take what he wanted until she said no.  He prayed she didn't.  

He pinned her against the door and made her painfully aware of what he wanted.  His hands squeezed her breasts and her bottom, pulling her against him.  Be far easier without clothes, but he didn't want to presume too much.

She seemed to like it. Her hands went around his waist and pulled him against her so she could feel his hardness against her. She bit his lip but that was the extent of her fighting him. She was following his lead.

Nox bit at her neck, sucking and pulling at her soft skin.  His hands pulled her shirt over her head.  He picked her up, his hands holding her bottom.  He walked over to the bed carrying her and kissing and biting at her.  He tossed her on to the bed. He took off his shirt and kicked off his shoes.  And then crawled on top of her.  He kissed ever inch of her body before he found her neck and bit.  Her hands wandered his body.  

What remaind of their clothes were shed in fits as Nox tried to maintain everything he'd started.  He didn't let the surprise show, she was letting him lead which with any other girl... woman, it wouldn't have surprised him.  Freed of the clothes, Nox found his rythym and made sure he rode that line between pain and pleasure.  Biting at her neck and breasts, grabbing handfuls of hair.  He wanted her to enjoy it as much as he was.

Her breath became shallower and faster as he brought her to climax, a soft cry coming from her throat as she raked his back with her nails. When she opened her eyes there was a definite look of fire now. He recognized it. It was the fight that he'd seen during their earlier bouts. She smiled wickedly and sneered and suddenly rolled him over so she was on top, mouth kissing and biting while her hips ground into and rocked on him while her hands held his on either side of his head. She looked predatory and in charge. He didn't like it.

Nox grinned up at her as he pulled the power into his self.  His senses heightened, he could feel every inch of her body against his, the currents on the air brushing against his skin, every smell.  He could see every pore on her skin, every scar.  He wove a small strand of air but did nothing with it as he moved his arms to her waist.  It took a bit of effort to get his hands so he'd have the leverage he wanted, which was good, it made it last all that much longer.  

It was fast, and quick, he rolled her over again, running his hands along her sides taking her arms up above her head.  He grabbed her wrists and finished the weave underneath his hands.  It was a glowing yellow band across her arms where his hand held her down.  He had to remember to keep his hands there, or release the weave.  He couldn't let her have even an ounce of thought that something was amiss.  He pushed back inside and gripped her wrists tighter, letting her know exactly who was in charge.  He didn't think she was the timid type, the one to balk at a little agression, but she wasn't getting back on top.  The power would make sure of that.

Nox thought of everything under the sun to keep the power from overwhelming his senses, from making the night end too short.  It wasn't going to be a marathon session like the last time, but he wanted to make it worth her time as well.  He didn't want to end it prematurally. 

He bit her neck, kissed her deeply, she tried to regain control and Nox grinned at her as he pushed her back down, she wouldn't have gone anywhere, he wasn't done yet.  The fire in her eyes made Nox  want her even more, she wanted to fight him, she wanted to take control, but Nox didn't let it happen.  Her arms stayed firmly against the bed, her body pinned underneath him as he moved and he brought her again.  He pushed himself until she came a third time.  Riding her final waves he kept her going until he finished himself.  Until he had spent every last drop.  

The power rolled through him, he dropped the weave that held her and rolled on to his back next to her.  He was breathing hard, but the power made everything feel glorious.  He didn't care what happened next.  If she wanted another go, he could manage, but it was because he wanted it not because she could have whatever she wanted.  He wasn't the colt she thought him to be.  He was a man, young but still a man.

***** Jacinda ****

Jacinda was surprised. Really surprised. Nox had always been a good ride but there was something different about him tonight. Something eating at him. Whatever it was, Jacinda had been game. After that first round- and there was no mistake that she'd enjoyed it- she tried to turn the tables.

Whatever was on his mind though, made him fight back. He rolled her from off him fairly easily despite the odd angle and necessary strength it took. The look in his eyes was feral as he began again, and she felt her own spirit echo his, let more and more of her own wildness out. She tried the same move he'd just done to roll him over and be on top but...no. She wasn't able to move him. She tried harder. He probably only outweighed her by maybe 20 or 30 pounds and yet try as she might, she couldn't even free her hands to push back. And all through it, Nox kept pounding away, breath ragged and eyes filled with hunger.

She liked it and fought harder, her body twisting and turning, muscles straining to gain some purchase or leverage but it was like her hands were in a vice, his hands cuffs that she could not break from. A feeling of being overwhelmed and loss of control grew in her as she struggled and he kept on. His kisses and bites were fiery and she responded in kind. Few men had been able to do this to her and the longer it went- the longer she was bound and not in control, the faster and harder he thrusted and pounded- the closer the pleasurea and the delicious flavor of pain kept getting to each other. And the wilder she became, the more animal and wild, all sense of restraint melting away under the body of this man-boy.

But he wasn't a boy, no. She hadn't expected this from him. And eventually, when it came, when her moment came, she felt a release that rivaled those that came right after a hunt. Her breaths came in great drafts, her heart pounding, her body sweaty and hot. And he was over her looking down at her, muscles corded and veins on his neck to show what she could feel, his own release.

He released her hands and rolled over onto the bed and she brought her arms down, rubbing at her wrists. They felt bruised, like they had been in handcuffs. He just lay there breathing hard, as did she. Thought was a distant thing. She felt relaxed and tired and satisfied. "Well Colt, that was unexpected. Surprising even." She laughed and rolled on her side so she could see him. "Good to know you can bring your A game."

It got quiet. At some point the TV had been turned off. She was about to turn it on and resume her program- he could stay. They'd probably have another tussle in a little bit- when she got curious. "What happened tonight Nox? What the hell was this about?"

**** Nox ****

He was glad she was surprised, he wasn't one to be ran over, the power raged through his body and he knew what the men who called themselves gods had felt.  The power, the glory, he had to push it all away, remember he was just a man with a gift.  It was difficult to do, to remember with the power coursing through him.  He dropped the power, the world dimmed, his energy fled and Jacinda asked him what it was all about.  He was surprised she had asked or even had to ask.

Nox grinned. "Been walking around for two days with images in my head.  You tell me why."  He wasn't about to tell her the whole truth of the matter.  He couldn't have Aria so he needed a release someplace else, someone else.  Though it was a scary thought to, Aria wasn't in her right mind when he saw her, what he'd dreamt about.  It wasn't right, nothing about that had been right. He wouldn't tell her, wouldn't even tell Aria what that had done to him.

She laughed. "Me and Aria?" She stretched out luxuriously and sighed. "That girl....she *is* something." She looked at Nox wickedly. "You know, I certainly wouldn't mind the three of us getting together." She sidled closer to him and her nostrils flared and her voice purred. "You could be the meat in our little sandwhich." And then she laughed teasingly.

Nox shook his head, not so much saying no, but to shake the images she's just put in his head.  "No, there will be no Aria and me as long as Lucas is there."  He closed his eyes.  "And probably not even then.  I'm not the relationship type, always moving, always just that fling.  No offense.  Aria needs stability not a flight risk like me."

She nodded her head as if she understood. "Well, you know how I feel about Aria. And you for that matter. At least I hope so." 

Her eyes were deep in thought. "I will confess something to you. I have a secret hope that the three of us could be a team. I don't know your sister, but maybe even her too." She was quiet for a moment. "I haven't really been part of a team for longer than a few missions, not since Regan." She reached out her hand to touch his cheek. "It's been kind of nice being with you both." 

She laughed and her voice lowered conspiratorially. "Can you imagine what we could do? How good we could be? The three of us?" She laughed delightedly at the thought. "With a Sentient on our team, a meticulous researcher and intel person, and you and me....you know, the Atharim really screwed up with that. I'm all for putting monsters down. But if you have a Furia or Sentient working *with* you....it's worth the risk." 

She looked at Nox's face and ammended her words. "Not that Aria is a monster. I know that. Her abilities are like a heightened sense of what all good hunters have. I know that she is human with human feelings. Anyway, all I'm saying is it is fun to imagine all of us working together in the CCD." Her face was split with a grin. "Like my dad used to say. It would be legen- wait for it- dary!" She chuckled. "Not sure where he got that from but I always thought it sounded funny."

Nox wasn't exactly sure how he felt about her confession.  They could be a good team, her experience was great, but she was a stereotypical Atharim, hard core, though she was accepting of Aria.  He grinned up at her.  "Aria wouldn't agree with you about not being a monster.  And I'm not sure I do either.  Aria's a sweet girl, but her demons, they are something else, that and her abilities."  Nox shuddered.

He took a deep breath.  "Since you know already, when I pulled Aria away from  you, she was fighting me.  I know she wasn't struggling.  But she was fighting.  She was pushing pain and fear and the world's suffering into me through that little bit of contact."  

Nox sat up and leaned on his elbow, "Aria is dangerous.  She knows it, she keeps herself and others safe, through me, through Lucas.  You accept the good parts, but there are parts you have no clue about.  Her father tried to kill her, the Regus said she should have been drowned at birth.   She's a world of pain and suffereing tearing at her walls every day."  He fell back against the bed.  "I don't know how she does it.  If you want to work with us, you have to deal with that, trust me on it, when I tell you don't touch her I mean it.  The man she obsesses over may be out of the picture, but the damage he did will linger for a long time."

The thought was depressing.  Nox was tired, he ached, he hadn't realized how much.  He sat up and kissed her softly.  "I'm going to bed."  

Normally he'd have waited until she was asleep to leave but there was little pretense here, it was about the sex and that was it.  He wasn't trying to get her number or even a name, he had one, the other didn't look like it was needed.  He grinned at her as he pulled on his boxers and gathered his clothes.  "Night Jacinda.  Thank you."  He bowed with a flourish and opened the door with his free hand.  There was no point in getting dressed when he was just going to climb into bed.  

Nox swipped the card on Aria's door and saw her sitting on the bed half alseep talking to he could only presume was Lucas.  He grinned at her and put her key on the table, then went to his own room.  He wanted to be alone to actually sleep, and with Aria sitting there he'd only half sleep.  They'd be home soon and he'd have his own bed back.  That was a thought.  

****  Aria ****

Aria had called Lucas just before Nox and Jacinda started in again.  It was not late for Lucas, he was awake, his day already started, and near ending.  He had enough to talk about.  She listened to his voice, and focused on him.  He'd asked what was wrong, and Aria told him nothing was wrong, just Nox and Jacinda having sex next door.  She had curled up in bed and they talked.  It was a strain, but Aria kept them out of her head, and her attention on Lucas.  They could have used the energy for more playful things, but Aria was tired, fighting this hard against herself was tiring.  And fighting when she couldn't give it away was even harder.

Aria did tell Lucas that Jacinda knew what she was, and that it could present a problem.  But she wasn't worried, she told him that, Nox would keep her safe.  She wondered how much Lucas actually trusted Nox, after what had happened.  It wasn't his fault, Lucas had apologized, but Aria hadn't gotten any information from either one about that call.  It wasn't exactly something she needed to know, it was like knowing their thoughts.

Aria felt their passion die down, she could relax a lot more with out battling their emotions so close by.  Nox opened the door with a grin and put her card on the table, he had a change of heart.  She was fine.  Aria wasn't sure if she drifted off to sleep while still on the phone with Lucas or if they'd parted ways, but she woke with the wallet still on her pillow.

A knock came at her door.  Aria got out of bed, rubbing her eyes and yawning.  She opened it to see Nox all dressed, coffee in hand with breakfast too.  He was in a far better mood, it made Aria smile.  He kissed the top of her forehead as she let him in.  He put the food on the table.  "Before I get Jacinda, we need to talk."

That was curious, but he'd mentioned something about the previous morning.  He sat down in the chair and started eating.  Through mouthfuls he spoke quietly, "I know how the godling is.  The woman I talked to yesterday.  Her husband is the godling.  He's sick."

Aria nodded.  Nox knew what he was talking about having gone through the same thing.  "How are we going to do this?"

Nox shook his head.  "We can't hide it from her, she'll figure it out, and I can't imagine what she'll do if she finds out we lied to her, she knows about you, if she finds out about me we are already dead."

Aria nodded and nibbled at a peice of bacon.  "We can't kill him though, but you can't teach him either."  They were at a cross roads.  This was a bad situation.

Nox sighed, "I'll tell Jacinda I found out this morning that the woman's husband I was talking to yesterday, he's really sick, like the sickness sick.  She'll kill him though."

Aria nodded, "I don't think we can stop her, if we don't want to blow your cover."

Nox nodded.  There really wasn't anyway around this.  "I'll call Jacinda and tell her breakfast is here."  

Nox laughed.  "Thanks."  And he continued eating and drinking his coffee.

Aria called to let the other woman know.  Aria opened the door so neither of them would have to get up.  Aria jumped in the shower with a lot on her mind.

**** Jacinda ***

Jacinda listened to Nox's explanation of what was going on with Aria. A part of her felt a chill. She wasn't sure at what, exactly. Aria was far more dangerous than she realized, if she could make others feel things. Especially since she was already wound so tight feeling what others felt. And yet a part of her was intrigued. There were times when she thought she could almost know what her prey was thinking, was feeling. Like when she'd held that dreykin kid's body over the dreykin, told it what she had done and would do, she could see the terror and impotent rage in its eyes. She *loved* it. She felt so powerful, so in control.

Aria could feel that too. It was intoxicating. That's what Nox was describing about the darkness and the danger to Aria. It could draw you in and make you care only about it, about the next fix. She had been all wrong in her approach to Aria. Or at least, hadn't been addressing the real fear, the real issue. She needed to rethink her plans. She understood Aria now. Fully. And she knew how she could help her, how her abilities and the difficulty she labored under could be used to give her strength. It was all about control. She smiled. It would come in time.

Nox was certainly coming along, that's for sure. He had done much to win back the initial respect she'd had and then lost as he got pissy. Very likely, that would be a constant thing, if they did become a team. But even then...look at what his *seeing* her and Aria had done to him. The darkness it brought out in him. He had come to her stronger, dominant, alpha. So much strength came from it. And he didn't even suspect it, probably. She would continue this with him. If he was emotionally volatile- and she knew he was a hothead that way- then she'd be able to keep pushing and pulling until he was in her court.

She stretched langorously on the bed, the feel of him inside her still palpable on her flesh. And then imagine him and Aria and her. Yes, that would be a thing. A team bound by flesh as much by trust and the hunt and the kill. All of them as one, a superbeing. The thought excited her, tingling her. She smiled and enjoyed the rest of the night before falling asleep.

A call woke her and she came over to Aria's room- the girl had just gotten up- and saw Nox with coffee and breakfast. "You know, you are going to have to let me give you some money. I haven't been pulling my weight in that regard. And I like to pay my way." She took the food and said thanks. "So, gonna be another long day, it looks like."

**** Nox ****

Nox grinned at Jacinda's comment about money.  He knew with Aurora it would be a sticking point, they had to fill out paperwork, more than likely she'd fill it out.  He'd gladly take the cash.  Or rather, he'd let Aria keep it.  "If that's what you want, Aria likes to hold on to the cash.  Something about not actually having any when a kid.  Not like you'd think.  She never wanted, just the physical money wasn't something her mentors let her have, credits all the way."

Aria was very childlike and then other times so not.  

Nox took the last bite of his biscuit, "May have a break."  He took a bit of the sausage on his plate.  He was famished, he felt good.  It was a good day despite the fact he was now lying through his teeth.  "Found out the woman I talked to yesterday, her husband, he's sick."  He looked up from his plate.  "Like really sick.  It was their kid that 'flew' from the fence.  And it was her father that the waitress mentioned.  That's a lot of coinsidences.  We knew most of that."  He cocked his head to the side thinking, "You weren't playing us were you?"

Jacinda looked at him puzzled as she laid into her food. "No. I wasn't playing with you. Kinda need names and relations before it suddenly becomes clear."

Aria took that moment to come out of the shower, he thanked whatever god was out there that she was dressed, in clean clothes despite the fact he hadn't seen her take any with her.  Maybe she was getting better at anticipating things, learning to make up for his weakness.  He grinned, it was a good day.

**** Aria ****

Nox and Jacinda were talking, Nox was in a good mood, it was like walking into a sunny beach compared to the way he'd been the past few days.  Aria wondered at it, knew it had something to do with last night.  But he was a far better anchor when he was being Nox, instead of being down.  

Aria took bacon off of Nox's plate with a smile.  "I miss something?"

Nox shook his head as he chewed.  He seemed to chew slowly, prolonging the answer.  Aria shook her head and smiled.  He was definately feeling more like himself.  Aria turned to Jacinda with a smile.  "Whatever you did last night definitely had an impact here on Nox's mood." Jacinda smiled in response but said nothing.

Nox grinned at Aria.  "Was just telling Jacinda what I found out this morning at the diner.  I talked up the waitress again, and recalled what the woman told me, that I'd talked to."  Aria knew it was partially a lie, he probably did chat up the waitress, proably hit on her too.  Could account for his good mood, his game was still working.  Aria laughed to herself.

"And that is?"  Aria smiled, "I can't read your thoughts no matter how hard you try to say otherwise."

He laughed.  "So we aren't going to hide this anymore?"

Aria shook her head.  "She knows, is there a point?"

Nox shook his head, "Alrighty then... Anyway, I said that the woman I talked to yesterday.  It was her kid that fell, her father who was miracousuly healed of dementia.  Her husband is real sick."

Aria nodded.  She already knew the problem, the question whas what were they going to do about it.  Aria sat down at the table and looked at Jacinda, "So what's our next step?  Despite the knowledge I have, I've never actually gotten this far in hunting process.  My abilities tend to be ignored once they find out it's useless to them."  Which wasn't a lie, but it hadn't happened over a godling.

**** Jacinda ****

Jacinda listened to the news. She hadn't realized that Nox hadn't already tried for a name with the waitress or that he hadn't realized the woman he was talking to was married to the godling. In all honesty, it seemed rather odd. She had assumed he had exhausted those sources first. That lack of information had led t their fruitless day yesterday. Well, not completely useless. She'd learned more things and thought that she was making headway with both of them. Aria's comment had made her smile. Nox was in better spirits. Definitely making progress.

She didn't want to blow that. Likely, Nox had just made a mistake. He was still young despite being a good hunter. She'd made plenty of mistakes in her life while tracking down prey. Things that could have meant her death if she'd not been quick to see it or to react. No harm done here. And she'd not say anything. Leave that goodwill she'd made last night strong. He'd remember next time. Get all the intel you can from a source before moving on. You didn't always get a second chance to reinterview. So she said nothing but "Good. Looks like we have a place to go then."

Aria looked to her for direction. Jacinda thought back to her last godling hunt. It had not gone well. Damien Oakland had been formidable and her attempts had been foiled at every turn. She hadn't told him who she was so she didn't think he knew of the Atharim. It still stuck in her throat, that failure. But she'd get another chance. Sometimes hunts took years. She didn't mind. She loved a good challenge, after all.

"Ok. So...you say he's sick. The sickness? The sickness. People have finally put two and two together about that, it seems." Well, they did once Trano opened his mouth. He was another one that she would have to track down. "Ok, so standard MO on this is that we need to take out the godling first." The 'first' implied more and she paused, unsure if they were ready for this. "This whole thing with the gods is genetic. It's inherited. Basically, we have two different species of humanity running around and they can interbreed. But one of them can call on lightning and other powers to survive."

A brief thought about Furia and Sentients passed through her mind but she dismissed it. "This is a war. Life is a war. And in war there isn't a lot of room for live and let live. Especially when the other side is so much stronger than us. *Especially* when essentially they are us, but with access to unimaginable powers." She looked a Aria and Nox. She had her own philosophy on all of this that she'd built up over the years. It was the way she saw the world. Humanity had to win. End of story. But some Atharim were more kind hearted than others. She knew Aria wrestled with her humanity. Again, there was that brief thought and she pushed it away. And she didn't know where Nox stood.

She decided she wasn't going to give away too much. Better to explain when it was all done. "We take him out quick and in a surprise attack. If he knows we're coming for him, he will use his power to defend himself. The good thing is that he probably doesn't know his power all that well. The godlings usually don't at first. Those that live take a while before they can consciously control it. So that gives us an advantage. Can you pull up a view of his house? We can start planning our attack."

**** Aria ****

They were really going to do this, they were really going to kill another person.  Aria was glad she was sitting down.  Everything from the night she'd killed the reporter rushed into her mind, how she'd flipped the switch on her humanity, how easy it had been, how much she had wanted to kill Dane, how much she enjoyed slicing the reporter up.  How good Dane felt.  

Aria got up and went to the bathroom in case her food tried to make a reappearance.  She could feel Nox's concern.  He didn't try to explain things, he probably didn't know didn't understand fully.  

She's been trained to do this.  It was her life, it was bound to happen, in order to keep her cover, in order to protect those she could, she would have to sacrifice a few.  

Aria took a deep breath and went back in and sat down.  She knew how she wanted to kill Ascendancy.  Knew exactly what she wanted to do, she only had to find the correct oppurtunity.  At least that was her plan, she prayed she never found that exact spot, the right place.  Aria wasn't a sniper, but she knew that it was the best course of action.

Aria looked to Nox with a frown.  He was far better a shot, it would weigh on all their souls, but he would likely be the one to actually pull the trigger.

"I've given it a lot of thought over the course of my training.  How to kill a godling.  For the reasons you say, they have this power that can just be used to squash us like a bug on the window.  Surprise and distraction aren't necessary.  Well distraction is not.  Surprise is key.  This godling is sick, pretty sure they can't use their power while they are doubling over in pain, shaking from a fever.  A bullet through the brain is the best possible scenario.  Scout the area, find the right spot where you can't be seen, and shoot.  No interaction, no distraction, just a dead godling."

If only it were so easy to kill Ascendancy, she'd be free and clear of the Regus' wrath, and could do what needed doing and averting the end of the world, or whatever that damned prophecy meant.  Though Aria was pretty sure it wasn't going to end anything, Ascendancy's death, it was just going to be a speed bump into the apocolypse.

**** Nox ****

Jacinda start lecturing again, he held on to the happy place, the resonance from taking back control of his life.  He held it tightly to his chest as he ate the rest of his breakfast.  

Aria got up and rushed into the bathroom.  Something was wrong.  He could tell but he couldn't help her, not right now.  If the darkness overwhelemd her he'd have to do something, but she came out, she was pale and afraid, he could see it in her eyes.  See the darkness only breathes away from coming out.  And then she started speaking...

Holy, fucking hell, Aria had given a lot of thought to killing a godling.  He probably should have asked her how she planned to kill Ascendancy.  He knew she hadn't planned on really doing it, but she had thought about it, good long and hard too from the sounds of it.  How to take out a godling...  He was probably more afrid of her at that very moment than he had when she was thinking about killing Jacinda.

Aria looked at him and he knew she wanted him to pull this trigger, or knew that he was by far the better shot, despite all her years of training.  It all sank in, everything, they were going to kill a man, a godling just because it was covering their butts.  Making sure some bad ass hunter didn't come hunt them instead.  His good mood drained away from him.  Nox wished Aurora had never found this one.

**** Jacinda ****

Jacinda was pleased to see that Aria had already figured this out. A good head on that girl. Jacinda was content to sit back let these two handle it afterall. The danger wasn't high- the godling really was sick and his use of the power was random. Let them cut their teeth on this. They really were a good team. 

She smiled and pushed her now empty plate away. "Sounds like you got it all figured out Aria. I can't add anything to your plan." She looked to Nox but addressed her words to Aria. "I assume you want William Tell here to take the shot, right?" She winked at him. "Use some of that amazing skill we saw with the Oni?"

At their nod she said, "Ok. I'll follow your lead." She was unclear who she was addressing, but that was ok. She'd let either one take the lead on this. She'd need to seperate from them at some point anyway. There was the protocol after all. She wasn't certain how they'd react to that and it needed to be done.

**** Nox ****

Nox looked to Aria, this was really happening.  He put on a fake happy grin, he knew it proably looked fake, "I need some time before we do this.  Not exactly a monster we are talking about here."  He felt the nausea well up and he knew it would take even longer for that to settle.  "An hour then we can head to his house."  

Jacinda nodded and Nox went to his room.  Soon as he had his gear packed into their bags he knocked on Aria's door, she was waiting for him, she knew exactly where he was, what he was feeling.

He sat down on the bed and cradled his head in his hands and shook it.  "I don't think I can do this Aria."

She sat down next to him and put hand on his knee.  "We have to.  You want her to know the truth, how we've let others like you go?  How we are friends with them?  Our lives would be in danger just for that, the fact that you are one, well that's another story.  It's us or him."

Nox flopped back against the bed, he knew she was right.  "That doesn't make it any easier."

Aria looked down at him her eyes were darker than usual.  "I'll take the shot if you need me to."

He sighed, "No, I can do it.  You know she's going to kill his family right?"

Aria nodded, but she didn't say anything, there wasn't much to say anyway.  "I can't kill a kid Aria.  I just can't."

She squeezed his knee.  "I know.  We'll have to stop her, reason with her.  Something because I can't do that.  It's bad enough now."

That was about all they talked, they sat in silence contimplating life and death.  Aria scribbled notes in holo mode on her wallet.  She was making an entry into her journal about godlings.  He watched as she drew the basics of a human man.  She'd add details later, after the kill, or maybe not, it was a generic redition of a godling.  She wrote down the notes about the mission.  The strange things, the sickness.  He watched as she flipped to another screen and wrote a note to herself.  

'This is the right thing to do.  You will come out of this.  "You have to do bad things in order to become a hero. You have to make sacrifices."  Do not fall!'

Aria looked back at him and Nox grinned at her, "That's meant for both of us, isn't it?"  She smiled but didn't say anything.  "Who said that?"

Aria shrugged.  "Father Dimitri never told me.  It was part of the training to kill a person."

Nox asked, "Are we trying to be heros?"

Aria smiled at him and shook her head.  "No, Nox, we aren't, we are trying to survive a war. 'There is good in everything; it's just how you choose to look at it. Everything that's worth it has a price... There are sacrifices. Life is meant to be a challenge, because challenges are what make you grow.'  We just have to get through this, then we can get back to normal life.  Back home and with our family."

He frowned, "Jacinda wants to go to the CCD with us, work as a team."  He saw the light fade from Aria's eyes, but she smiled.  

He could tell she was more than just saying it, "Then we'll deal with it as it comes.  We can't hide forever.  You, me, we stick together, we can do this.  It's why we are here, why we work so well together.  We'll do it together."

Nox laughed, "I was in such a great mood this morning.  I shot my own self in the foot."  He paused a moment, then got up off the bed and held a hand out to Aria.  "I think I've a sniper rifle in the Jeep, one of my Dads.  I'll have to dig it out, pretty sure it's on the bottom of the pile."

Aria nodded, and they went outside to the Jeep.  Aria packed their things inside it.  After this, they couldn't be here.  They had to look like they were checking out.  Nox paid the bill inside and knocked on Jacinda's door.  They needed a bit more privacy to dig in the back of the Jeep.  He took a deep breathe, they were really going to do this.

**** Aria ****

This was going to happen and neither she nor Nox were happy about it.  They sat and talked and were quiet for most of the hour Nox had requested before they got started.  Aria offered to do the deed, Aria was pretty sure Nox had never killed a person before, godling or not.  Aria wasn't thrilled and Lucas would probably not be happy she had either, not that he knew about it, but still she knew he'd be disappointed, but there was little they could do about it this time.

Aria was saddened that Jacinda wanted to go to the CCD with her, but it was also excited at the same time.  Aria knew that Jacinda was a great hunter, and she could learn a lot from her, but she also felt her darkness, the rabbit hole was ever the more closer and deeper when the woman was around.  Aria hadn't decided if that was a good think or a bad thing.

Nox's mood faded and was replaced with horror and determination.  He was determined to survive this war.  It was good, but Aria was afraid for both of them.  This was their first kill, their first godling and hopefully it would be their last.

Nox drove past the Keen house, and found a nice empty place that had no view from the top or most of the sides, it was good to be in the sticks, the canopy of trees would insure they couldn't be seen from above, and the thick brush helped hide them as well.  Nox dug through things in the back of the Jeep.  He was meticulous in things, putting everything in a specific pile or order that he deemed appropriate.  It was funny watching the usually unorganized twin be so very organized.  They shared many traits, and yet they were so very distinct.  Aria never quite understood their nature towards each other, but she knew that they both treated her like a sister.  It was a very different feeling from her actual family.  Alex had never really been overly sisterly, almost always the doctor.

Aria scouted while they waited for Nox to get things situated on his end.  Aria could feel the godling inside the house.  There really was not a good place to do this.  They could only hope that there was an abandoned or empty building they could use, or the trees it would be.

The area was full of trees, large trees and small.  Some would be good for as a perch, and deep with in the woods there actually were tree stands, but around the Keen house, there wasn't.  However, there seemed to be a barn that looked rather empty and rather delapidated, it might work, but that was up to Nox really.

Nox joined her, he already held the power, he was empty to her, his eyes were sad.  He carried the rifle over his shoulder.  There was little more needed for this effort, but Aria had her gun and her sword as usual.  But Nox had the most powerful weapon he needed.  He could easily kill the man without ever firing a shot, but that wasn't going to work with Jacinda close by, and if she weren't here, they wouldn't be killing this man either.

**** Jacinda ****

She could tell that Nox and Aria weren't as amped on this mission as they were on the others. She could understand that- to an exent. The godlings looked and seemed the most human. And yet they were the most dangerous because they had access to powers unimaginable. If life was survival of the fittest, then one to one, the godlings were more fit. That made it war. Simple as that. A thought nagged at her and she pushed it away. She knew the sayin, "power corrupts." She'd seen it many times herself. What would be the result of people with the power of the gods?

She wasn't a bookish person, by any means. But she knew enough Atharim lore to know that the myths and legends about oppressive gods was based on fact. Mankind had shed much blood throwing off the shackles of those gods, getting their freedom. They had kept their freedom by ruthless vigilance. That old myth about an Egyptian king killing off a bunch of kids who were a threat. Or maybe it was about Jesus or something. She didn't really know religion or anything, but it sounded correct. In any case, sometimes you had to do what you had to do despite how distasteful it was to normal human sensibility. Survival didn't really have anything to do with morals.

She watched Aria and Nox plan and added nothing to it. It was a simple and good plan. She could almost beg off and say they could handle it. Of course, that wasn't true. Not that they'd not be able to take out the godling. But there was more to this assignment. Aria would get there one day. Maybe Nox too.

Aria though, made her think, especially about her abilities. She was glad she was on their side. In the coming war, they were going to need people like her.

Nox wanted some time. Jacinda decided to leave them to it. She'd do her own thing while they worked. The guy's parents and kids probably weren't all at that house. "I think you both have got this. I'll stay around here."

**** Daniel Drake ****

It was a normal case, sole survivor of an explosion, completely unharmed.  But it wasn't percisely normal either, others were looking into the matter.  He knew that others were out there looking to do harm to others like him, but Daniel Drake he'd never actually run across another, much less three others looking around the same place as him.  

They were an odd pairing, a young kid, paired with an older woman and a younger one.  Daniel wasn't exactly sure what their thing was, since they'd arrived in town, he'd watched them too.  They'd explored the explosion site and found nothing more than he did.  He watched them at the diner, chatting up the waitress and another woman.  The young kid seemed to be personally interested in her, despite the ring on her finger.  

Daniel found out who the woman was, he intended to talk to her the next morning to see what was going down.  He stayed the night in his car, watching the three who appeared to be rather entertwined with each other, the young man having switched rooms several times that night before settling into his own room, leaving the ladies to their own rooms.  

He watched as they looked like they were ready to leave town.  The two younger pair went off in one direction, the older lady staying behind for whatever reason.

He'd follow her for a little while, see where she lead him.

**** Nox ****

In the bottom of the storage area of the Jeep his father's rife lay collecting dust.  They'd used it on occassion to hunt with, but most of the time it was uncalled for, there was only one monster that really needed a sniper rifle, and that was a godling.  His family had never taken one down, not for as long as Aurora's books said anyway.  You could use one with a rogue wolfkin if you wanted to, but they typically acted more animal like and on pure instinct so taking one out normally was easy enough.  Not that he'd ever had to do it.  This was his first human looking kill, rougarous didn't count, they were cannibals, and rapists and not human despite having been.  

Nox laid the rifle on the ground, he was alone, except for his gear, Aria was off scouting places.  He looked at the rifle with sadness and disgust.  Nox really didn't want to shoot another human being.  But he would, this time, to keep his cover with Jacinda.  It was bad enough he was killing a human, but he was killing a man like him, someone who actually didn't know what he was doing.

Nox headed towards the house with the power raging in him and found Aria looking towards a barn that could act as cover.  It looked pretty run down, a former chicken coup, lots of windows, maybe a good line of sight.

Aria pointed to the area of the house the man could be found.  She didn't look any happier than he did, and he could see the frown lines on her face despite not actually much of a visible frown.  The power brought many details to life he knew he didn't really want to see.

They crept into the dilapidated barn and up to the second floor, there were pieces of the floor missing, and it felt like it swayed in the wind.  Nox did his best to reinforce the floor they walked on with air.  His power came in handy for more than one reason today.  

Nox took a deeep breath as he set up the rifle.  It was a simple thing really, but in this rotten place it wasn't quite so easy to do.  He looked through the sights of the gun and saw the man lying on the couch curled up in a blanket.  There was no one else around, it was now or never.  Equiped with a silencer on the barrel of the rifle, Nox took aim and another deep breath, there was little left to do other than pull the trigger.  It felt like hours passed, but it was just a moment.  The power raged through him.  Nox squeezed the trigger and he watched as the bullet sailed through the air.  The distinct thunck of metal meeting bone made Nox turn away from the shot.  He knew the man was dead, it was clean and quick.  He took a deep breath and sat down against the wall.  He put his head in his hands and felt like crying.  But the tears just didn't fall, he felt the pain of it, but what was worst of all was that there was a sort of thrill that ran through his body.  He'd enjoyed it on some level.  

**** Aria ****

The bullet flew through the air, she felt the man's pain end with little more suffering that he had already been in.  The fever was wracking his body, and then it was gone.  He was gone.  Aria watched Nox, felt what he was feeling to every degree possible.  He turned with sadness and joy and Aria knew that Jacinda's words sank into him too, the darkness inside, the world couldn't accept what they did, but it was what they did.  Aria didn't want to kill this man, but maybe in the end they'd saved more lives.  But if Nox could have taught him how to control his power, how many more lives could they have saved with it.

Nox sat there, Aria didn't push him, didn't rush him, she didn't want to touch him.  Feeling the emotions was enough, she didn't need a hands on feeling too.  It could push her over the edge, the darkness loomed close, it was there, just out of sight, always there, waiting for just the right time, when her guard was down it would surge, be too powerful to control. 

Aria sat down next to Nox and they waited for the time to pass.  Time for Nox to regain his senses, time to get up and move, and leave this place, leave it for home, and never look back.

A car door closed bringing them back to the real world...

**** Jacinda ****

Jacinda watched the godling's home from down the street. She had figured the woman would pick her kid up from school and be home soon. She knew Aria and Nox were siting the house from the back. If the target wasn't dead, he would be soon.

A car pulled up and she saw the dark hair of the wife as well as the light brown haired head in the passenger seat. This needed to look like an accident. As she thought about it, though, this could kill two birds with one stone. Perhaps a burned house could damage the soon to be dead godling's body and take out the bloodline in one fell swoop.

She watched mom get some groceries out from the back seat while the kid skipped to the door to open it. She said something indistinct and the kid looked at her and answered. Jacinda smiled and casually walked along the street until she was close to the house.

She crossed the street and walked up the walkway just as the sound of a scream pierced the quiet. Jacinda bolted in the house. Guess it was now. Nox and Aria would be putting stuff up and it was her only chance.

She heard noises coming from the living room and pulled her gun as she walked on to the scene. The woman was screaming and fumbling with a phone while the little boy stood still in shock.

Jacinda wasn't going to use her knife. This was a quick kill. There was no reason to make it suffer. While godlings were more dangerous than a nest of rougs, they still were just potential dangers that needed to be put down. A meaningless line, perhaps, but still her line. She'd do the job but this wasn't a hunt, not really. There would be no rush here.

She lifted her gun and aimed for the back of the kid's head.

**** Daniel Drake ****

He followed the woman around, she waited outside a house for the occupants to arrive.  There was a peircing scream and everyone ran into the house, the woman following another woman inside, presumably the person who lived in the house.

Daniel followed them inside, he pulled the power inside him, it was a battle, every second, every moment it took to tame the beast that the power was.  Inside, he found the woman holding a gun to the back of a child's head.  A child's!

She was here to kill the family, he looked around and saw the body of a man lying on the couch wrapped in a blanket, blood was soaking the couch and the blanket and dripping on to the floor.  Daniel felt the need to vomit, but he sneered instead, fighting back the nausea.  

Daniel wove a weave of air and snatched the woman with a gun and flung her against the wall and pinned her body to the wall, she hung inches from the ground.  He frowned at her and her actions.  Daniel turned to the woman, "Leave.  I'll take care of this.  She won't bother you again."

The woman stood frozen, he yelled, "Go!  Take the child!"

Daniel tied off the weave that held the woman against the wall.  He made a weave of electricty in the palm of his hand.  He walked closer to her, the energy arching from his fingers to his palm.  It was a display he never thought to show another person.  He stood with in inches of her.  He looked up to her as she hung against the wall like some sinister painting.  "Did you do this?"

The woman sneered at him, triumphant look on her face. "No. No I didn't." Her smile widened as she looked him over.

Daniel frowned, "Then why are you here?"  He held the arching energy in the palm of his hand close to her body threatening her.

She looked at his hand and didn't appear fazed at all. Nor did she do anything but smile at him. Her eyes held contempt and hatred.

She was a piece of work.  He doubted that there was much he could do to scare her, but he wasn't a killer either.  At least he tried not to be.  Sometimes though killing someone with the sickness was better than letting them surive until the 'poison' ran its course.  He put his hand against her body and felt the electricity course through her body.  

He removed his hand and asked again.  "Why are you here?"

Her eyes stopped bugging and she stopped screaming but there was no fear or pleading in her eyes. She smiled- somehow she had blood in her mouth and the edges of her teeth were lined red- and spat at him, a large bloody wad.

Daniel wiped the vile substance from his person and continued with the line of action he'd started.

**** Nox ****

The world was spinning out of control, he was now one of the monsters he'd killed, he killed an innocent person.  And he could feel the presure building from the thrill of the kill, it pulled at him.  He could feel Aria's eyes on him, he knew she could feel what he did, knew she felt it too herself, each time that she killed a monster, she'd killed before, for the pleasure of it.  It scared him.  

Slam!  A door closing.  A high pitched scream came from inside the house, someone had found the body and they were still sitting where the shot had been taken.  He looked at the time on his wallet, they hadn't been sitting there that long.  Dammit!

Aria was piering over the edge of the window.  She closed her eyes.  "Jacinda just ran into the house, after his wife.  Someone followed her in."  Her words were barely a whisper.  

All thought of being careful through the dilapidated building was gone, they both ran towards their way down.  Nox saw an opening in the floor and jumped down.  

Another scream, one he recognized, it was not that of the child, but of Jacinda.  As he came out of the barn, he saw a woman carrying a child as she ran from the house, she left the door wide open and sprinted down the street.

Nox ran into the house, the power coursing in his body, he felt the presense of another like him.  He peered around a corner.  Jacinda was pinned against the wall.  The man was torturing her with the power, he kept asking her why she was there.  She was giving him nothing.  

How was he going to do this with out Jacinda finding out who he was, what he was.  Aria came in the back door, but the man caught glimpse of her, the power running along his hand disappeared as he wove a weave Nox knew all too well.  Nox threw up a wall of air between Aria and the man.  The fireball let lose and colided with his wall.  Aria was back behind the wall again.  She hadn't known where the man was, but she did now.

The man turned towards him, "Come out.  I know you are there."

Nox knew he did.  But he wasn't coming out without a plan.  Nox wove his whip of fire and air, and made the ends extra sharp, he wasn't going to get more than one shot at this.  

He stepped into the door frame and the man turned just as Nox let loose the whip and it coiled around his throat.  Nox yanked the whip and the man's throat was slit completely around, his head hung limp as he fell to the ground.

Nox let the whip weave fade as he wove another weave of solid air and knocked Jacinda out with it.  She'd wake up with a headache.  There was only one way to finish this now.

"All clear Aria, is anyone else here?"

Aria stepped out from her hiding spot with a frown.  "No one else, just the three of us."

He looked to Jacinda and she still hung in the air.  He smiled at the weave and untied it and watched it disapate into nothingness.  Jacinda fell to the floor.  
Nox and Aria took Jacinda's limp body to the Jeep.  Aria kept watch while Nox went back and set the house ablaze with the power.  He made sure that the bodies were the center of the flames and the hotest part of the fire.  There would be no evidence left.  He also set fire to the dilapidated barn they'd used no point in leaving any potential evidence there either.

He walked quickly back to the Jeep.  Aria had restrained Jacinda while he was gone. They went back to the motel to grab Jacinda's things and then they left.

He didn't know exactly where they were going, but right now they needed away from the scene.  And then they had Jacinda to worry about.   

**** Aria ****

Everything went wrong all at the same time.  Someone had come home.  Someone had followed them, Jacinda.  And now there was screaming.  

There was little thought in things from there on out.  Aria followed Nox towards their entrance, but he jumped down through a hole in the ground.  Aria wasn't going to risk landing in correctly.  She took the stairs, nearly losing her footing more than once.  

Aria saw Nox take off through the front door, she went through the back.  She could only feel Jacinda, she felt the pain and Aria pushed it away, she had to think, she knew a man was inside, but where.  Aria hated the idea that there was only one way to handle this, a man who could channel out to get them.  It was the only option to the situation.

Once inside Aria was careless when checking rooms, she'd not gone slowly, the adrenaline running through her body, the darkness pulling at her, Jacinda's pain callling to her.  The man released a fire ball from his hand and it struck an invisible wall as Aria darted behind another wall.  She could feel the heat despite the wall of air, it could only have been Nox.  

Aria peaked around the corner and saw Nox switch his firey whip around the man's neck and pulled the razor sharp edge through his skin, the muscle and the blood veins, it cauterized as it cut, the man fell to the ground as Nox uncoild the whip and it vanished from sight.  

As if the site of blood had been too much Jacinda's body went limp.  Nox called out to her and she answered knowing he was still holding the power in him.  She could see the darkness in him, the pain from befor was gone, replaced with the same thing she felt, she could see it in his eyes.  But there were things to do.  Jacinda's body crumpled to the floor, Nox having done something she couldn't see to release her.  

Aria picked up her feet and Nox her head and they carried her to the Jeep.  They were both spent, Nox was dragging, Aria could tell even though she couldn't feel him.  Jacinda was alive, she breathed.  Nox went back to the house to finish things off.  Aria tied Jacinda's hands and feet just in case.  Nox was now a monster to her, and now was not the time to deal with that exchange if she were to wake up.

Aria could hear sirens heading their direction, the fire burnt in the air Aria could smell the burning wood, she thought she could almost smell burning flesh.

They drove for hours before stopping.  They pulled off into an empty wooded area, the only presence for miles was that of wolves and critters in the trees and burrows below.  They would be safe for now.

When they were on the road, Aria called Lucas, he hadn't answered, she knew he was in class at that time.  She told him she was okay, they were all okay, but she wouldn't be able to talk tonight.  They had some things to deal with, she'd explain later.  

Aria set up camp, laid out Jacinda's things and they carried her to the bag near the fire, they untied her and let her sleep off everything.  Aria prayed this went down quickly but she knew that a blow to the head was going to take some time to recover from, not to mention her other wounds now.

Aria sat on a log she'd dragged over.  Nox leaned against the log, his shoulder touching her leg.  It was almost as if they both craved something more than just waiting.  Contact, understanding, it didn't matter.  They sat and watched the fire crackle, both lost in their own thoughts, just waiting.

**** Jacinda ****

So there were two of them it seemed. Interesting. They hadn't expected that. The new godling picked her up and threw her against the wall before binding her- all with his power. Her skin prickled as she felt that power once again. But she wasn't afraid. She'd never show fear to these things, no matter what. She was the hunter, not them. If they got the drop on her, that was life. But she chose how she reacted.

He asked her if she had killed the other. She sneered at him and answered him. He wasn't satisfied so he asked again. She was done with him. She wasn't his prisoner. She would tell him nothing, no matter what.

He did something with his power and suddenly she was jerking about as every muscle in her body contracted and every nerve lit on fire. She tried to scream, but her vocal chords were too tight. After an eternity, it stopped and he asked her again. She smiled at him, the taste of blood in her mouth, and spit it at him. He could do what he wanted. She'd not give him the satisfaction. She was fucking Jacinda Cross.

Suddenly there was motion and he saw Aria come in. The godling turned to her and lifted his hand, a wall of fire rushing at her. It....flowed around nothingness. And in the center stood Nox and Aria, his own hand outstretched.

The fire stopped and a whip seemed to materialize in Nox's hand, made of fire, somehow. He whipped it at the man and the man's neck gouted blood as he fell to the ground. All she could do was stare at Nox before blackness enfolded her.

She woke slowly to the smell of burning wood. She could feel the warmth of a fire. But it was a small one and they were outside. It was pitch black. She was in her sleeping bag. She sat up- her head still hurt- and looked toward the fire.

Nox and Aria were sitting, Nox at her feet, leaning against her. The image burned in her mind. Nox and Aria, Aria and Nox. They were looking at her, had been waiting for her to wake. Like they were awaiting her decision. She wasn't stupid. She knew either of them could have killed her if they wanted to, right now. They could have done so when she was sleeping. They could have let the other godling do it.

What were they thinking, letting her live? They had killed the godling. It had to have been to protect their secret. So why were they doing this now?

Her mind threw up another question. How? How could a godling be Atharim, a hunter? She didn't understand it. Too many questions. Not enough information.

She stared at them for a while. She wasn't scared. She just wanted to understand, need to understand how all of this worked. Nox at Aria's feet. It reminded her of a hunting dog at its master's feet. Was that what was going on here? Where they something, despite Nox's protests? How did Lucas' fit in?

The crackle of the fire and crickets was the only sound until Jacinda finally spoke. "So....you care to explain how this works?"

**** Aria ****

Aria felt when Jacinda was about to come around, her thoughts had to be chaos, the confusion, questions, there were always questions.  She sat up and looked at them.  But there was nothing said, nothing.  Aria felt Nox tense up as he slipped from her senses.  Aria was thankful he had a weapon he could never be severed from.  Aria folded her hands in front of her, weapon free.  She didn't want to have to kill Jacinda, it would be a loss to the world, she was good at her job, probably too good, but it would still be a loss.

Aria didn't smile as she wrapped her self in the bubble, her voice cold and distast.  "You tell us.  You know our secret.  We don't kill humans unless we have to."

Jacinda tilted her head. She was clearly puzzled. "Um....you two are the ones with special abilities, not me. AND you both work for an organization that mostly wants to kill you. Clearly, that's a you question, girlie, not a me question."

Aria smiled, but it didn't reach her eyes, emotions were gone, there was nothing but her and the void the bubble created.  "Thus it's a secret. We were born and raised Atharim.  The cause, still good, except for one small minute fact."  It wasn't small by any means, and Aria was sure that the sarcasm was not laced in her voice, that required emotion.  "The question isn't how we explain this.  It's how you react to the knowledge that there are monsters within the walls of the Atharim."  Aria put her hand on Nox's shoulder.  "We don't want to hurt you.  But we will maintain our secrets."

Jacinda smiled. "That's the real question now, isn't it." She breathed deeply but seemed relaxed. "You, I don't have a problem with. But I already know that it is YOU who will have a problem with my problem with Nox here." She pursed her lips. "This is your team, isn't it. You both use your abilities in the Atharim, despite the fact that they'd kill you"- she looked at Nox- "if they knew." She shook her head. "It is a puzzle." She seemed to look at their relative positions. "So...what's this. Are you controlling him? Is he on a leash or something? He's not seemed very leashed to me. Hung up on you, sure. But not leashed. How does this work?"

**** Nox ****

What the fuck did she think he was, a dog?  He would not be leashed, he was not controlled.  Aria tried to calm him, and that made matter's worse, he brushed her hand from his shoulder and stared at her.  Was she controlling him?  He shook his head.  No, she wasn't so sublte, he knew that much.  He turned towards Jacinda and leaned forward and the venom in his voice was clear.  "I am no dog."

Aria put her hand back on his shoulder and pulled gently back.  "Nox.  You know you aren't.  Don't make this worse."  She smiled at him, emotions drifted through her eyes.  "You can kill her if she tries anything."  The look in her eyes said she was thinking along very dark lines.  She was fighting the darkness and it scared him.  He knew she couldn't feel his hatred at this moment but she still fed on it.  

Nox sat back, "Fine you deal with her."

Aria spoke in the cold place, there was no emotion it was that place he hated to see she went in a fight, it meant death was around the corner, or that she was being overwhelmed, either way it wasn't good.  "It's a matter of symbosis.  The classic anenome and clown fish scenario.  I need someone to stablize me, Nox needs someone to fight with, someone who doesn't balk his every move or treat him like a child."  Aria smirked, "Kinda like what you do to him, his sister does the same.  We are a team.  I control him no more than he controls me.  We work because our lives depend on it."

Aria stared at the fire, Nox watched it play in her eyes as he looked back at her.  She continued, "One slip, and the both of us could be dead.  Today, you are lucky.  We've killed a man all because we were protecting ourselves from someone finding out.  And now we get to defend ourselves against the very person's life HE saved.  Because Jacinda, there was no way out of it.  That man was not a new godling, he's been around the block."  The wrath and the anger were clear to him despite the fact that she was inside that bubble of hers.  She was done playing games.  It was live or die in this world, and Aria clearly wanted to live.  He smiled, that was a much better change than when he first met her.  Though he wished the darkness wouldn't creep up when she was so ready to live.

But the more she spoke the worse it got for Nox, he knew the rabbit hole was near by.  He put his hand on Aria's knee and got on his knees in front of her.  "Aria.  It's okay.  You can't do it like this.  I'll stay calm I promise.  Please, come out of that emptiness."  He dropped the power, he was her stablizer, it took this to make him understand, go figure.

She stared at him with those green eyes reflecting the firelight.  He saw the fight in her eyes.  It was never easy fighting the darkness.  She put her head down and craddled it in the palm of her hands.  Nox sat next to Aria, and looked at Jacinda.  "It's up to you Jacinda.  What do you do with the revelation?  I am no different than I was hours ago.  I hunt monsters.  It is my life, it is all I know."

**** Jacinda ****

Oh yeah, that did it. Nox was pissed. Not in a childish way. He bridled at her word in the same way she might. She understood that feeling. Didn't mean it wasn't true. Just that he resented the suggestion.

She listened though. And what they described made sense. It was a symbiosis of a sort. It played out right in front of her. Aria was definitely looking darker at this moment. She remembered their little tryst after the dreykin were killed. When Nox pulled Aria off her. The same darkness played across her face, as if she were warring with herself. And then Nox did something, and Aria seemed to take control of herself, putting her head in her hands.

This was far more complicated. She chewed on the inside of her cheek while thinking. She felt herself intrigued though, as Nox finished his little speech. A monster- two, really, if you wanted to be technical- were inside the Atharim. And from everything she'd seen, they really did the work. They were good hunters.

An image came to her and she smiled to herself. She stood there with two leashes. One held a sleek black panther, as dark as night. The other a heavily muscled tiger. The pulled at the leashes periodically but she held them tight. And when she wished, she could set them loose and bring down whatever she wanted.

For some reason, the image thrilled her, the sheer raw power it embodied. These two here, with her. Her nostrils flared at the potential, far greater than what she'd imagined before. Her mind went back to her encounter with Oakland and Dane in Mexico. With these at her side, things might have been very different.

Her smile became genuine and she relaxed. In her mind the issue was settled. Of course, there was no reason to tell them everything she was thinking. If he'd balked earlier, he'd probably kill her now. She could be reasonable. "You are Atharim. Everything I've seen confirms it." She laughed. "Obviously, this is a surprise. You can't expect me to just throw away what I have been taught and have known for most of my life- what the Atharim is, after all- that easily."

She paused. "But...perhaps I have been wrong." She looked at Nox. "Your secret is safe with me. Both of you." She laughed. "I have to confess, that thing with the whip, that was pretty impressive." A thought occurred to her and she laughed long and hard. "So you've been keeping this secret all this time. When we went after the oni? The dreykin? Hot damn, man! Now that is impressive." She wasn't pretending. All this time, Nox had this power that could have put down the oni or dreykin with ease. But he fought normally. "You are you mother and father's son, Nox."

She saluted him. "I gotta say, I'm curious to see what you can do when you aren't hiding." Another snort and she was nodding to herself, eyes awash with the image, with the potential. "What a team. You gotta let me join you."

**** Nox ****

Jacinda said she'd keep their secrets.  That was good, but how far did that go.  Where there things that would make her take that back?  They had no secrets to keep her in line, it was not the same relationship that he had with Aria.  No, there was mutual risk involved, for Jacinda, she gets pissed at them, and she could reveal all, and they'd be as good as dead.  He sighed.

He didn't want her to reject everything.  He and Aria struggled with it everyday.  They struggled with it a few hours ago.  There was nothing wrong in what they did, except they had killed a man for the mere fact that he could do damage to the world.  Yes, he'd killed people, but it was an accident.  

Jacinda said she was wrong.  Nox nearly fell over, it was not something that he'd ever thought he'd hear from her.  She was one of those, 'my way or the highway' types, at least thats the feeling he got the more he got to know her.

She liked the whip.  He did laugh at that, Aria had said pretty much the same thing around about the time she saw him use it.  Then it was against a horde of super creatures they still had no idea what the hell they were.  That had been a day.

Nox preened with the praise.  It was almost like a peacock strutting his feathers, he realized that he was far too impressed to hear words of praise from a legendary hunter.  But he couldn't help the grin that washed over his face.  He wasn't about to tell her that it was because of the power he was able to do that, though he could have easily sent everything up into flames and that would have been the easy way out.  Nox was too engulfed in the praise to do much more than that right then.

**** Aria ****

The darkness threatened to swallow her whole.  The tension in Nox' shoulder, the entire air built upon the need to push fear and pain and suffereing.  The venom in his voice made Aria want to plant her dagger in the throat of the woman who was provoking her friend, It was a wonder that it all came out as cold and distant as it had.  She'd let her shields go so Nox could see not to make matters worse, in more ways than one.

Aria answered the question, it was a simple answer.  They were a team, it was complicated how they worked and she'd not understand, could never understand.  She was normal, well mostly.

Nox dropped the power and looked at her, she saw the fear in his eyes and knew that he understood.  She centered on the calm, it was difficult for him, his emotions went everywhere. He beamed with pride as Jacinda bestowed praise upon him.  But Aria managed to keep herself from the darkness.  From the pleasantries of the kill, the hunt.  It was one thing to let it lose on the dark creatures of prior wars past, but a complete other version when it snapped into being based on pure selfish thought.

Jacinda was a mix of curiousity and Aria knew the feeling of possessiveness, it had filtered into her from Dane.  But that was for later.  She wanted to join them.  Aria wasn't sure what to think.  Nox had relayed to her that she had wanted to come to the CCD with them.  Aria didn't look up.  "I think there is a way to test how well we work as a real team."  She sighed and looked up.  "In Aurora's notes there was an artifact found, it was still partially buried in Howe's Cavern.  It was were one of the instances the waitress told us about which we hadn't needed.  The connection, I can only think was that the dearly departed had set something off unknowingly with the use of his power."  She looked at Nox, "which means you don't use your power near it!"

Nox grinned at her, his mood having improved slightly, which made it far easier to stay on this side of the line.  He nodded his head, "Okay."  He looked to Jacinda, "You in?"

Jacinda smiled widely. "Hell yes."

Aria nodded. "We'll head back that way before we go then.  We are leaving for the CCD after Nox gets his things set off.  You are welcome to join us, but we are not staying here.  It's far too dangerous."

Nox laughed, "It's not quite so structured here, poor Aria is adrift."

Aria elbowed Nox in the rib.  "You like your nice soft bed too."

He grinnned.  "I do."

Nox went got up and laid down on his bed roll with a releived sigh, "I'm going to bed."

Aria rolled her eyes, not that he could see it, but she felt him drift off into sleep, he was tired.  He'd had a rough day.  "You should probably catch a few more z's.  Ones that aren't from being knocked out."

Aria slide down the trunk she'd been sitting on and leaned against it and watched the fire.  Jacinda could do what she wanted it didn't matter.  She'd let Nox sleep.

**** Jacinda ****

Jacinda smiled at Nox's grin. She'd meant it. But it also meant that she had power over him. Enough, anyway. A thread, not a leash. But it was a beginning. Aria would be harder in some ways, what with her sentience. But in other ways, easier. That darkness that called to her gave her a way to control as well. As long as she had handles on them, she was content.

They really would be a good team, she suspected. With none of them hiding or holding back, there was no telling what they could do. Again, that image came to her mind and she smiled as she laid down and put her head on her pillow. A panther and a tiger hunting at her command would take down any prey. Aria and Nox working with and for her would be the greatest team the world has ever seen. She was still smiling as she drifted off.
