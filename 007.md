**** Jacinda ****

Jacinda moved quietly through the trees, her boots carefully placed to create the least amount of sound. Her eyes scanned the surrounding greenery, her eyes focused and unfocused at the same time in that way that her father and especially Regan had taught her. There was an order to the chaos of nature, the way the branches grew and crossed, the way the leaves fell and scattered and settled, the pattern to the bark. It was purely random and if you allowed yourself, you could sense the lack of a pattern, the pure chaos.

But if a man or creature passed, in some small way that pattern was disrupted- a slight clumping of leaves having been shuffled together, a new unweathered scratch on a tree, the hanging of a snapped twig. By opening oneself up to the complete lack of pattern, one could see the sudden order that was imposed by a creature's passage. And the signs would tell you if it were small or large.

This one was large. She crept closer to scattered leaves, the crushed leaf still held together by its myriad veins. By itself it told nothing. But the pressure on the green leaf had gone through to the moist earth underneath. Not enough detail for most people, but Jacinda saw the slight impression of a large toe and ball of a foot. Too big a ball and toe for a cat. But it lacked a heel. The print indicated the creature walked upright....but it wasn't walking upright.  

A brief estimation of gait found another disturbed group of leaves. Carefully brushing them away, showed a tell-tale indentation, deeper than the feet. It was leaning forward on its front as it moved, then, the weight heavier int he front. Its back legs were longer than its forelegs. The outline of 4 pads clumped in a row together...and that of a thumb. Not a claw or finger. A thumb. She smiled. No question. Her quarry had come through here.

Feeling the density of the earth let her have an idea of the thing's weight, how heavy it had to have been to leave these impressions. It was big, just as she had heard. You never knew. Things were always seen in the woods out of the corner of the eye or moving quicky through the brush. It made any reliable information very hard to come by. Even so, it appeared that the thing was at least 100 pounds heavier than she was. That put it at a 250 easy. Not much compared to a say an elk or a bear. But this was far more deadly.

Her hunt had started days ago, with rumors of a local Bigfoot drawing her to the mountains of the Sierra Nevadas. Most people dismissed such things. But she knew the truth. While 4 times out of 5 it was just a local legend, that fifth time turned out to be much more than people knew. Just as well, really, that amatuers were mostly unsuccessful. The creatures the Atharim hunted were deadly and took training to take down. It was necessary work. But more than that. Jacinda loved it. Times like these, she missed Regan. It had been 25 years. Still, even so, when on a hunt like this, moving carefully and slowly, tracking through the woods, she could almost feel him with her, his hand occasionally on the small of her back, the faintest sound of his breathing, the movement of hands indicating their plan. Her senses would be flared, alert to the slightest change, the tension building and building until it seemed she could hold it no more. But hold it she did, hold it she would, as Regan taught her, until it could be channeled. 

When the creature was cornered and faced them with those too human eyes, then the tension was released in an orgiastic climax and it was a fight, the pure and most basic struggle of all- kill or be killed. Right up there with eating or fucking this was what life was about, the eternal test of fitness. And she relished it, gave into every human impulse and emotion she had. All her memories, her fears, her anger and rage and sorrow purged themselves in the fight, washed clean in fire and pain and blood and death. And she would stand on the other side, baptized again through life, purified and alive. They would fuck right then and there, marking the place where they had been victorious, covered in dirt and pain and blood, they fucked like wild animals, in sight of their now slain quarry. And when she came, it was like being born, the genes of a million years crying out in joy as they proved they had been worthy to pass on, that the drive and hunger and traits they represented were the best to offer. Life orgasmed with her.

Regan was gone, had been gone. She'd had hunting partners from time to time. They might even fuck after a kill. But none were Regan. Regan had been taken from her by rougarou. Stolen. Another reason for anger. Another reason to hunt. Another reason to kill. And she'd take her time, as she always did. This one was more elusive than a roug or a chupa. Human intelligence and the wildness of a wolf. Not simply a person who spoke to wolves. As vile as that might be, this was worse. A man who thought himself a wolf. Killing animals. Scaring people. Even killing people. Didnt' really matter much what they did. They should not be. And so they wouldn't. It was her job. Lonely, yeah, maybe. Sometimes. More often than not she had to celebrate by herself, at least until she could hit up a dive or bar and find someone to do it right. 

But it was a living and she was damn good at it. Evey day showed that she was the epitome of life, the culmination of billions of years of evolution and drive, unstoppable, the inexorable force of life that did whatever it took to survive. Not a human on the planet was not a descendant of creatures that did what was necessary to survive. These were truths far deeper and more transcendent than human morality. This was life at its core, pure and simple. Survive and reproduce. All else was merely human invention. And she was the product of that drive. She was not ashamed. It made her the best damn Atharim this continent had ever seen.

Gradually, she came closer to her prey, the adrenaline aleady flowing through her, readying her for yet another contest. A contest she would win.

**** Nox ****

They'd been driving a while.  Nox was tired, Aria didn't drive, had no desire to learn.  Not that Nox would have been a good teacher, he didn't have the patience.  They'd been driving all over, working cases.  It was nearing time to head home, They'd have to head back East to catch their flight out.  But she had to see the other side of the country.  Nox was enjoying showing Aria around.  He was amazed at her tracking ability, inside and outside of the city, she was a natural.  She'd track the trails as easily as the emotions.  What didn't she know how to do, other than be around people.

They'd been staying in some pretty crappy places, but not this time.  They were nearing Tuolumne, California.  He intended to have a good time she could hang or not it really didn't matter.  The Black Oak Casino was really the only place in that town, but it had gambling, girls and drinks.  It probably had a few stories to tell that they could hunt out in them thar mountains.  It was very different than being in Moscow, at least Aria was good company, most of the time.

They got a suite in the hotel at the Casio, it was far easier to stay together and not stay together.  Nox didn't trust himself around Aria, and Aria was not his girl.  Lucas was a lucky guy, Nox hoped he got that.  Sure she's messed up, but who isn't.  

Two bedrooms and an ajoining room, Nox had saved up for this, he wanted to show Aria that even being around people could be fun.  He was planning on dragging her to the bar this time.  He doubted she'd gamble any of that precious money, he doubted he would either, better spent on beer than on chance.

Nox talked Aria into leaving her coat and weapons in the room.  It was a bit of a talk, she didn't like being unarmed.  So what did she do, she put her hair up into a bun with chopstick like things sticking out.  She grinned as she gave a slight twist of one and a very needle like implement pulled out.  Nox gave her that one.  She wore her typical attire though, black t-shit and jeans that hugged all the right places, and her black combat boots.  She wasn't trying to win awards, but Nox wondered what would happen if she was.

Nox pinched his arm, he had to put his mind elsewhere, that girl was off limits.

Nox didn't dress much better himself, a pair of jeans, and a white t-shirt under his baby-blue long sleeve button up shirt, though it wasn't button nor tucked in.  

The bar was pretty empty, he took a booth in the back corner, it was round and they could both kinda have their backs to the wall, he'd never hear the end of it otherwise.  He ordered two beers and a water for Aria, he knew better than to even ask, because he'd get that look.  And she would have fun, even if he had to drag her out dancing.  

**** Aria ****

Nox insisted she go out with out her weapons, which meant her coat wasn't needed.  But she didn't go out with out weapons, not ever.  Thankfully she'd brought the hair sticks she'd had made in China.  They would do.  

The bar had a few people in it, for this hour probably to be expected.  A man at the bar wearing a suit, from the way he was feeling Aria was pretty sure he was cheating on his wife.  The guilt and lust couldn't quite make up their mind what he wanted to feel.

Two men were drowning their sorrows at the bar, probably a bad luck at the casion.  There was a couple sitting a few booths away fro Aria and Nox.  They looked like they were traveling.  On their way to Yosemite or something.  Aria and Nox had been all natured out by the time they'd reached the Black Oak Casino, it was one of the reasons, Aria had agreed to stay there.  While she liked the lack of people out in the mountains, but that was just empty and very disconcerting.  Probably all part of Nox's plan.

One bartender was female, she looked and felt like she was in a bad mood.  No telling what had made her feel that way.  The second bartender was floating across the bar like he was high.  He definately felt away from his senses.

A woman walked in.  She was confident, collected and from what Aria could sense was ready for some action.  Aria watched as she surveyed the bar.  She moved like a wolf, like a hunter.  Aria glanced at the woman's left arm and saw the snake biting its own tale.  Aria wished for sleeves.

Nox looked at Aria, he was getting pretty good at reading her, he turned to look the direction she was looking then smiled at her, "We'll be fine.  I won't use my power, you restrain yours.  She won't be any the wiser."

Running into a hunter was not Aria's favorite thing, particularly here in America where the hunters lived by their own law.  The last thing they needed was a hunter who killed first and asked questions later.

Aria couldn't take her eyes off the woman.  It wasn't fright, or curiousity, she could almost recognize her.  But she couldn't put her finger on it.  And then there was her emotions, all of it drew Aria's eyes.  Aria knew Nox watched her, he leaned back in the booth and pulled at his beer.  He was curious to her thoughts, he grinned at her knowingly, "Well looky here, Aria ain't so straight laced after all.  Does Lucas know?" Nox watched her watch the woman.  It was all very surreal.  Nox's emotion started to boil and Aria was having to focus keeping him and this woman out of her head.

**** Jacinda ****

The contest had been fierce. The man had been feral and fought with the skill of any wolf. His teeth had been sharp and his nails long and she had gashes and bite marks in addition to the normal bruises and cuts that taking down a creature brought. She used a gun whenever she had an opportunity, but this one was fast. And, if she was honest with herself, it had been awhile since she had fought something hand to hand, to face the winnowing selection and come out on top. The man had died with her blade jutting up under his chin and into his brain, but his body had taken a few more moments to realize it.

She'd cleaned herself up with anti-biotics and taken a few shots as well, in case he had any diseases that might have been transmitted through his bites or nails. They were pretty strong and kinda knocked her for a loop. While she was still flying high, emotionally and sexually, she just didn't have any outlet- well, other than herself and that just wasnt what she wanted. She wanted another person's body. When she finally made it back to town, she was frustrated and ready for something. Things had been anti-climactic and she didn't like that.

She went into the Black Oak Casino, intent on prey. The longer she went, the more frustrated she was becoming. Course, she didn't like that. She was in control. She needed to relax. Maybe it wasn't the best idea with the meds in her, but she went to the bar and ordered two shots of tequila. She also ordered a beer to sip on, once the shots were down. They had just been to get her high. The beer was to slake her thirst and maintain the buzz. Mixing didn't concern her in the least.

The bar was a long cedarwood-top that had been sanded and polished and varnished. The place smelled of wood and smoke and beer and old-leather and sweat. The mirror behind the bartender allowed her to survey the room. It was the usual group. Older men with large graying beards and big guts, hard eyed women. The bartenders were a possibility- either of them- but it just wasn't what she wanted.

A couple came in. A pretty boy- dark- and an equally dark girl. The man was almost too pretty, though there was a smirk on his face that said that he was a joker, which was appealing. Guys like that knew how to use their hands. She felt herself smile at that and turn around to watch the man from the corner of her eye.

Strangely, though, her eye kept drawing to the woman. Dark as the man, there was something about her that she couldn't put her finger on. A different kind of darkness. Her eyes noted her full lips, the downward turn, the emerald chipped eyes that kept alighting on her. Without meaning to, Jacinda saw the way the shirt molded itself to her breasts and hip. On the main, women were not Jacinda's thing. Oh, she'd been with them, but that was usually when there was another guy involved and the whole thing turned into some sort of frenzied craze. Defintely an after hunt party. She certainly enjoyed the way a woman knew her way around her body, knew what pleased and what teased, how to touch and kiss and lick. But there was nothing like feeling a man, all hard and muscle, try to dominate her, that she could wrestle with and not hold back. Women were too weak, usually, for that sort of thing. Regan hadn't been. They had had some tussles, especially as she got older and grew to woman-size.

Still, this woman....there was something there. She called for three more shots and then, holding them in one hand with her fingers at the lips- people who came into this kind of place should not be fastidious- and her beer in the other, she walked to their table and dropped the drinks down.

"This is a bar. Drinking is required. So is having a good time." She smirked at the man. Flirting with him would be easier. They always thought with their dicks anyway. It would be expected. As for the girl...she'd feel her out. She smiled at the thought. Maybe she would. "And I'm here to make sure that you do."

**** Aria ****

The woman came over.  She was definately hunter, it was in her walk, in her look and defininately in her emotions.  Aria watched her move, Nox's emotions nearly bursting out of his stupid grin.  She dropped three shot glasses on the table, Aria shook her head, "I don't drink."  Aria told the truth, "Killed a girl once while drinking."  Aria smiled playfully.  It was easy to harness Nox's jovialness, he busted out laughing.  He knew fully well it was the truth.  Aria didn't know if he laughed because he thought it was humorous she was making a joke, or he was playing along.  Both would fit with Nox.

Aria turned the woman's arm over so she could see the tattoo more clearly, "Interesting design.  The tree of life inside the oroborous."  Aria smiled. Aria prepared herself for the emotional onslaught that was shaking hands.  She offered her hand in greeting.  "Aria.  That's Nox.  I'm sure either one of you will enjoy the shot more than I would."

**** Nox ****

Nox was having a good time watch Aria watch the hunter.  Made his mind go back to where it had earlier.  When she walked over Aria made a joke, which wasn't really a joke, it was the way she said it. Nox really couldn't help himself, he laughed as he took the shot.  He slung it back and it burned going down.  He was going to pay for it in the morning.  Maybe he'd wake up next to a beautful woman because of it.  Either here would do.  Nox thought, I hate you Lucas.

Aria introduced them after inspecting her tattoo.  He could careless.  His wasn't that old.  It still looked new, so did Aria's but the elements were slightly old too.  He knew the story.  

Nox grinned at the woman.  Her dark hair and eyes.  She was a few years older than either of them.  He couldn't help himself, he put his arm around the woman.  And leaned back in the booth, he issued the playful challenge, "And how are you going to make sure we do that?" 

**** Jacinda ****

Pretty boy Nox put his arm around her. He was a cocky one. She liked that. The girl- Aria- hadn't wanted the drink....but she had touched her arm. And then, curiously, honed in on the tattoo. Her mind pulled itself together. Most people just thought the symbol was cool. It had been around for millenia, after all. But something in the way the woman had looked at it...Without looking at Nox- though she did enjoy the warmth of his arm around her shoulder. She'd see if he was up for a good match. If not, he was gonna be sore tomorrow. And likely sporting a few bruises in the face, that was for sure. Jacinda was a strong tall woman, statuesque. It took a real man to hold their own with her. Again, Regan flashed to mind and she pushed the thought away. A real man....or woman.

Her dark eyes settled on Aria's, watching them. Her buzz was nice and strong and she was flying. But she was in control of the flight. Aria's arm rested on the table. It was Jacinda's turn. Gently she reached for the arm and turned it over. An ouroboros was clearly visible, though surrounded by two dragons. Her eyes lifted to Aria's slowly, a curve to her lips. "Always nice to meet a sister." She looked to Nox. "And you?"

**** Nox ****

She looked at Aria's tattoo and asked after him.  He held his left arm out, nothing special.  It was the tattoo that his dad had, and ran in his family. It wasn't a snake so much as a leg-less chinees dragon that made a figure eight on his arm.  It was oriented to not be the infinity symbole for more room, and more detail.  But it was meant to be infinity.  His dad's had been all black, as was his mom's but he chose red and gold, It was much brighter than theirs, and he didn't want to be exactly like either of them anyway.

Nox pulled on his beer before speaking.  "We've not seen another since we left Moscow."  Let her question all over that, he was clearly American.  Aria, well she seemed to blend in well any where, but her accent was clearly Italian today.  Nox wondered if she prepared ahead of time.  He knew she spoke several languages.  Girl knew so much he didn't, but then when you travel around the whole CCD you needed to know a lot.


**** Aria ****

Lucas had done Nox's tattoo based on a picture Aurora had.  Girl came prepared.  It ran in their family, much like her's had.  Such was the life of those born into the Atharim.  

Nox mentioned Moscow and Aria gave him a look, she didn't want to share specifics.  Not now, they didn't know her.  They probably didn't need to be here any longer, Aria hadn't told anyone other than Tehya she was going to the US.  She probably should make a trip to Mexico since her name was still all over Dane's file.  She should probably remove that, she wasn't likely to hunt him as she was to hunt Alex.  But he was a flight away, and Aria didn't fancy making another plane flight, more so than the one she has to make again.  She wasn't looking forward to that.

Aria had to close herself off from both the woman and Nox, they were bubbling pools of sex and drunk.  Neither of which would end well for Aria.  The woman hadn't offered her name.  She still couldn't place her, she knew she'd seen her somewhere, and that was saying something because Aria didn't know the American branch of the Atharim well.  It would eat at her all night, unless she asked, "I know you from somewhere."

**** Jacinda ****

Jacinda sat back and took a pull of her beer. She was completely relaxed. The kid- she thought of him as a kid. He was a good 20 years younger than her, though that mattered little to her. She knew she was attractive with a healthy appetite. And at least young guys had the egos and staminas to help her along. Usually. And he was Atharim. He'd do perfectly.

Still, her eyes rested on Aria. Not quite as young as the kid. Young enough. Something familiar in her eyes too. So it surprised her when Aria commented that she knew her from somewhere.

It took her a moment of thinking before she realized what it was about the girl. It was the look in her eyes. The struggle. She was still in the middle of it. Still fighting. Jacinda had seen that when she was a kid and first with Regan. After that first kill and the night they'd made love, he took her on selected hunts. She understood it now. After the hot blood of that night had worn off, she had been scared. Regan became her rock. But going out and killing things that 'looked' human, well, that had been hard. She had been young. She still thought of them as human. So Regan would take her on hunts for things that it was easier for her to kill. And he made her do it too, made her shoot or cut or stab.

The memories were hazy, but she remembered the look in her eyes. She loved the look on Regan's face, the pride he showed in her, the confidence. He made her feel powerful, that she was not helpless. She would not be killed like a little bitch. She'd loved her parents, but they had been weak. She would not be that way. She was learning to love the contest. And yet....still, there was the weakness in her, the fear at what she did. She remembered the first time she'd had to kill a roug that looked like a boy. That had been hard. He'd fought with the strength of a man. And Regan had let her do most of the fighting, only making sure it never really got the upper hand. But plunging the dagger into its eye....she'd had to do that. It was a monster. She'd known it. But it had looked like a boy.

Both sets of emotions had flooded her: relief, triumph, arousal; fear, guilt, sorrow. Both sets of emotions warred in her. The look in her eyes. She remembered. This girl had it. Still struggled. She looked at her tattoo again. There it was, engraved on her skin. Poor kid. Suddenly, the attraction she'd felt for the girl was overlaid with a mothering desire. This girl needed her help.

She reached out her hand and put it on the girl's arm, on her tattoo. Her voice was quiet. "It gets easier Aria. I promise." She smiled reassuringly. "I've been where you are. You will get through this fight. You will win." After a long look- the girl had to know that she knew what she was talking about- she took her arm back. She continued to look at the girl. "I'm Jacinda. Jacinda Cross."

**** Aria ****

The woman touched Aria's arm, it was a jolt to her system, and Aria hoped no one noticed.  Nox probably did, but he was already used to the silly nuances of her ability.  The woman was a tangled mess of emotions - a mashup of every possible scenario, but she sounded like Lucas. Almost word for word, and she had absolutely no idea what her issues were, but coming from a woman like her, a hunter who was still alive past her 40's,  Aria bet she had stories to tell, words of wisdom.  She was nothing like Antoinette, where her lines were soft, Jacinda was hard.  There was a darkness about her, yet she lived a relatively normal life.  

Aria smiled.  "I've read about you.  Our American brethren aren't so strict with the records as we are, but you've hit the database on many accounts.  And I've actually read through the Durante books Nox's sister keeps.  You've had a few run-ins with his father and mother.  Quite the stories."

Nox interrupted, "Aria's getting her own stories too.  Killed an Ijiraq and a drainaka.  And if things go right she'll be more famous than you."

Aria glared at Nox.  "You know that none of that is true, despite what I've told the record keepers."  Aria turned to Jacinda.  "I had help killing the Ijiraq and the dranaika I didn't kill.  Never claimed to kill it, but since I called for the clean up I got the kill.  Something far more scary killed that."

Nox laughed.  "Ever so modest.  But we could kill a drainaka, Aria, you and I.  I know it."

Aria shook her head.  "We'll find out one day I'm sure Nox."

**** Nox ****

Nox blinked at her name.  He'd heard of her too, he had been surprised that Aria had.  That's saying a lot, but then again Aria had been hunting for like minded individuals as of late for her little rebellion within the Atharim.   

Nox smiled.  "Now looks like we got someone famous sitting with us, Aria."

"My Dad used to tell stories about meeting you and Regan.  He'd say, 'A couple of damn good hunters to have on your side when your in a pickle'. Though I'd never thought I'd actually met you one day."  Nox was in awe.  He'd heard tales as a child growing up.  Their names were actually in some of Aurora's books from back when Mom had done them.  One last living memory of her anyway.  Aurora kept her books going, it was actually kinda funny cause even across the ocean Aria had journals from her line too.  Some pretty old books too.  Nox didn't really care about them, that was Aurora's department.  But Aria's they were fun to look at, hers anyway, considering she was dating an artist, her work was pretty fine if you asked Nox.

Nox hadn't been shot down yet, he might actually get a first on every guy's bucket list - have sex wit someone truly famous.  While Bas would go who the fuck, there wasn't a hunter in America who hadn't heard of Jacinda Cross.  That was an accomplishment to him.  Nox started to rub the base of her skull as he downed the last shot sitting all alone on the table.  He wished he had Aria's talent for reading emotions, he really had no idea how to get this particular strong minded, bad-ass woman into bed.  He'd figure it out, but Aria's skills would come in handy.  

**** Jacinda ****

She laughed as Aria told what she had heard of her. It seemed only right. She'd learned from the best. And if every hunt was a another way of showing that you were the best there was, well...of course they had heard of her. Damn right!

But at Aria's mention of Nox's parents, she turned at looked at him, reassessing him. Yep, she could see it now. He had a lot of his father in him. "Well I'll be damned! You're Bryan and Cleo's kid! Hah!" She took a drink. "Good folks, your parents. A shame what happened. Damn shame." It was quiet for a moment. Hell hounds. What a thing that was. She had never faced one herself of course. She'd like to, one day. That would be the ultimate test. But Bryan and Cleo. She had been a kid, still being trained by Regan. They had only been a couple years older than her. Three young people and Regan leading them. Damn, but it had been a good few hunts. It made her somber. Alcohol did that, made her swing to whatever dominant emotion she was feeling. And now she felt nostalgic. She held out her drink in a toast. "To our fallen brothers and sisters. They paid the ultimate price."

Nox had been rubbing her neck. She was a strange jumble of emotion. He had a cocky smile on his face. She liked that. Here she was, knew his parents, a famous hunter, and rather than be intimidated, he stepped up his game. Yeah, confident. Definitely a turn on. Course he'd find out what bedding her meant. If he thought she would be demure and let him drive, he was in for a surprise. A big one.

She looked at him- Aria forgotten for the time being. The day's activities, the alcohol, and now the sense of nostalgia had created a hunger in her that needed to be quenched. She'd have time for the girl later.- and said "Honey, I hope you have some idea about what you are doing. Otherwise I'm going to eat you for breakfast." A half-smile to show that she was only half-joking.

To Aria, "Sweety. I'm gonna take Nox here for a little ride. You are welcome to join us if you want." She didn't expect it and didn't wait for it. "But if Nox can still walk tomorrow, you two can join me. It's been awhile since I've hunted with others- well, others I would trust. If what he says about you is true- and I don't doubt it from the look of you- I think we could have a lot of fun." Let her make of that what she will. She was pretty. And Jacinda did want to help her.

To Nox, "I'm going to get a bottle of tequila from the bar. You get us a room." To Aria, "Night sweety."

She was already laughing inside, all the tension and desire from this afternoon's hunt coming to her, the missing of Regan and her past. This boy- Bryan and Cleo's kid- and damn but she would have loved for the four of them to have had some fun, that's for sure, if they had been up for it- was a link to the past and a hunter to boot. No one understood the sex-hunger that took over after a good hunt except a hunter. At least, they understood best.

She smiled as she headed to the bar. What a good day it was turning out to be.

**** Aria ****

Aria wasn't surprised by the toast, but the nostalgic feeling was lost on her, she hadn't know them, but Nox looked in brighter spirits than he usually did when the mention of his parents came up.  His mother dying by the hellhounds had been one of the first thing she'd found out about Nox, and later his father dying, potential suicide or at the least a drug overdose, they hadn't gotten a proper autopsy or such as was typical of the American Atharim, they were very above the law type people.  At least there was some set of rules in place.  But they didn't have the structure the European branch had.

Either way Jacinda was going upstairs with Nox.  After she left, Nox slide Aria her key to the suite.  He'd commandered it when they left so she couldn't go back up stairs.  Nox grinned at her, "I'd not come up for a while.  Go call Lucas or something.  I'm sure you can find something to do.  I don't want put you in your neighbors situation."  

Aria shook her head with a smile.  It wasn't the first time he'd left her to go play with some girl.  But Jacinda was no ordinary girl.  Aria hoped he knew what he was doing too.

**** Nox ****

Nox grinned at Jacinda.  He could hold his own.  She hadn't wasted any time in getting upstairs for some fun.  Nox slipped Aria her key and warned her, he really didn't want her feeling him and Jacinda, it was just weird knowing that she knew what he felt.  But he didn't want her overwhelmed either with another hunter so damned close, and the invitation to go hunting with her, yeah they knew they were doing that without even talking about it.  You couldn't pass up the oppotunity to hunt with a legend.

He left Aria and headed to the bar.  Nox put his arm around her and tapped the key on the bar, "Already have one."  He didn't mention the status of said room, it was his treat, a luxurious hotel, a fine bed, and it seemed famous company.  He was set.  Granted he wasn't key on drinking more tequila.  He wanted to remember this.
