**** Aria ****

Aurora had set the flight for three days later.  They used Aurora and Nox's tickets for their return trip home as they were open ended.  Aurora had to transfer it to Aria, but she did it all, and there was nothing left to do but get on the plane for Aria.

Aria had spent as much as humanly possible of those three days with Lucas.  He still had his life, his things to do, but the nights were hers.  She didn't hunt, just spent the time with him.  It had been a good three days.  Almost too good.

The closer the day came to leave the more Aria started to worry about the flight, and the time with Lucas had only made her not want to leave him.  But it was an experience she was never likely to get again.  She sucked it up and met Nox at the metro and they rode in together.  Her gear was going to be the harder of the things to get on the plane, permits or not.  Everything had to be checked and stored properly.  Not a problem.  But really annoying to be without all her weapons.  Every weapon was in the plane's cargo hold.  She felt naked.

Nox was paler than usual as they sat on the plane.  Aria wondered how well they were going to do on the trip.  They were just sitting on the plane waiting for everyone to board, and they were both already unconfortable.

**** Nox ****

Nox kept running through the conversation he'd had with Lucas a few days prior to this very flight.  His concerns over Aria leaving him.  And now that Lucas had brought it up, it concerned him too.  But Nox also believed Aria needed to be her own person.  She was a mess to begin with.  From what he knew of her, she'd only gotten worse coming to Moscow, and after Dane, well that was another story.  But Lucas didn't know about Dane, that night, or about the real issue Aria had.  He had to promise Aria he'd not say anything to Lucas.  They would get there one day.  It would be a bad day.  That secret would make or break them, and the longer it went, well there was no telling how Lucas would react to the facts.  

Nox couldn't judge her, he didn't think he'd be sane after what she'd gone through, and for her quirks she was pretty put together - all things considered.

Lucas had asked Nox to keep her safe.  He didn't have to ask, it was something he'd have done anyway.  Nox wondered if there was underlying worry that he was taking Aria away from Lucas.  Nox had no designs, not anymore, on Aria.  She confided in him, he took care of her, and she took care of him.  He could be 100% himself with Aria, that included the annoying child or the prick he knew he could be.  It wasn't that she understood him, he got that it was all about what she felt.  And she read him like a book more often than not.  

Nox was doing everything in his power to not think about the plane ride they were about to take.  He could feel his heart racing in his chest.  The last flight he'd been in had crashed.  Granted it was his fault, but still it left bad memories and feelings in your head whenever you had to get on the plane.  And now here he was again on a flight.  

The plane started to move and Nox gripped the arms of his chair, Aria put her hand calmly on top of his and sent calming feelings to him. He smiled at her but it was weak, she squeezed his hand.  Aria wasn't afraid of flying, she wasn't comfortable but she wasn't afraid.  It was the inescapable vessel that bothered her, there was no escape from the people's emotions.  The crying baby four aisles back was a nuisance to them, but to Aria it had to be like a piercing shreik in her minds eye.  The hunger, the annoyance of flying, the pain of dozens of people's ears popping at the same time.  He couldn't imagine, she'd gotten better at her control, even in the short time he'd known her.  She seemed to grow by leaps and bounds in her control, the more she understood about herself.  Nox assumed that was from Alex too.  Bas' girlfriend, bed buddy, whatever, she was the girl he called more often than others.

Once the plane reached altitude and they were cleared for electronic devices, Aria put on her headset and curled up in her seat.  She looked child like.  He smiled and put on his own music.  Anything to keep his mind from things.  And for some very strong reason the power beckoned him, tempted him.  Like it was its own person.  It had been an accident.  It was clear to him then, and now.  And Nox knew it was his mind playing tricks on him.  The darkness lingered, it wasn't his, it was Aria's.  He looked at her and he could see her thoughts had shifted.  There were too many people here.  He held her hand.  She calmed him, and he calmed her.  Together they'd make the flight.  

**** Aria ****

The plane was stuffy, or at least it felt that way to Aria.  Everyone was feeling something the close quarters, the crying baby, the discomfort from flying.  It was really not a good situation, and Nox he was remember his last flight, it could only be the possible explanation for the fear hear was feeling.

He was pale, Aria could only help to a degree she wasn't exactly feeling great.  It wasn't fear, but it was confining and that wasn't good.

They both drowned their feelings in music, Aria focused on Nox and tried to calm him it was a rather boring flight despite all the anxiety they both felt.  The food on the flight was okay, there was no major incidents.  Nox kept his ability at bay, Aria tried to keep herself intact by avoiding most things, but the tiny bathroom was necessary and that meant walking through the cabin through the horde of people.

And then back again.  It was all a mass, the baby crying just wanted to be held, and the mother bounced it on her knee trying to soothe it.  Aria rolled her eyes, but said nothing.  It always was annoying to her when the baby was emoting what it wanted and the mothers had no clue.  Aria wondered if Alex's mother had understood her children's needs easier than other mothers.  It was a curiousity.

The take off and the landing was the worst part for Nox.  Aria was uncomfortable the whole flight, and once they landed in Atlanta it was better.  Still stuffy with people, they chose to walk instead of ride on the crammed tram system.  

And they were free of the airport until they'd gotten most of the Durante family legacy.  Aria wondered how many places they were going and what else they'd be doing.  The hard part was just starting, being away from Lucas was going to be a trial, but Aria knew she had to do this, it was a test and it really was something that she had never gotten to do before, she was almost a little excited after the plane trip anyway.
