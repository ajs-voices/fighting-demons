**** Nox ****

They had to hail a cab from the airport to the long term parking he'd put his Jeep in before he left for Moscow.  Aurora was an information nut, she had everything, encrypted on her phone so no one could get to her important information, which with her memory shot made things difficult for her.  But now they had all the information they could have used to figure out who the hell they were, and why they were in Moscow.  It was rather ironic.

Aria didn't seem much into the sight seeing, she seemed more interested in just relaxing, the cab driver was a talker though, Nox didn't think he shut up the whole ride. Aria looked touristy he guessed.  She definately sounded it when she spoke, though he knew it wouldn't be hard for her to pick up another accent.  He'd seen her move from her normal italian accent, into a frech one, and russian too.  She'd probably float into southern redneck or coon ass easily.  It's a good thing they wouldn't be in Georgia long.  He didn't want a peach walking around with him.

Aria paid the driver, she enjoyed handling the American money.  He didn't understand it.  Maybe because she'd not actually seen it before.  But they still didn't have much cash, everything was credits on their wallets, it's how they were paid.  It was easier to pay the cabbie with cash though.

Nox was not looking forward to paying the long term parking bill, much less the shipping his Jeep home.  But he was glad to see her sitting in the parking garage under the tarp.  He'd normally not have cared but there was still some things he and Aurora had left there expecting to be back soon.  Seemed like soon wasn't ever going to happen, he didn't intend to stay.  He missed home, but he liked Moscow.  It was easy enough to get work there.  And transferring to employment had been realitively easy considering the Atharim had established institutions for such things.  It really was quite the gedup they had over there.

Aria didn't act much like a tourist, but she was clearly seeing things differently than where she grew up.  It was probably a good thing she didn't drive, all those Europeans drove on the other side of the road.  

It was a hefty bill Nox paid, but it was worth it.  His Jeep was worth the trip to the States alone, he'd be happy if he had to leave now, but he had every intention of taking Aria out and about and showing her his home.
