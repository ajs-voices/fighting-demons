The Baccarat Mansion was the jewel of the Baccarat collection, it was illustrious, the Tzars collection was displayed in all its fine glory on the first floor.  It was guarded day and night, the security was top notch.  The peices were set a drift among the construction designed to display the greatest peices Baccarat Crystal known to man.  

But underneath stood a vault of immense proprotion.  It was guarded by the same security that the crystal above was.  But inside this vault was not the treasures of the family business.  No, it housed an immense database and collection of raw books that went back ages, from the beginning of known time - as far back as anyone could remember, some said even further.  There were relics untold, and men and women who kept the aisle filled with study and knew the wonders it held.  They too were the treasure inside.

These men and women were much more than caretakers of lore and legend, they were the protectors of mankind.  Eliot Lagueux, walked the halls of his home.  He was a living heir to the Baccarat Crystal, but he was not THE heir, he would never run the company, he would never hold a title other than son.  He was not of that world, he lived in the shadows now, a hushed rumor on the wings of the aristocrats his family kept up with.  He was not a bane on his family, he was just a costly expense, until he made his worth known to them.

Eliot was the curator of sorts, he was the only living heir of the Baccarat throne that was left in the Atharim.  He was not a hunter, he was the caretaker of the money they donated to the society that kept the world safe from things that go bump in the night.

But there was a secret that the world did not know, a secret that Eliot kept dear to his heart, one that could mean his life, and the lives of so many others if it were to come to light too soon, if the timing were not correct.  Eliot was a monster of a whole nother breed.  He was a god! Or so the Atharim lore spoke of anyway, Eliot did not feel godly, he didn't feel special either.  He was what he had always been, a sick child of God who could not heal his own self.  The irony of his gift, he could heal the most fatal of wounds and leave not but a scar, but he could not lay hand on his own self, to heal whatever had ailed him his whole life.  But he was the monster within.

It had been a fateful day, the day he ran into a girl.  Her name was Aria.  She was stunning, she had the grace of a hunter, a wolf, she was after all trained in all thing Atharim. Eliot knew he was not alone in this world, he knew others like him existed, how could he not when he ran the latest headquarters for the Atharim.  He had direct access to everything Atharim.  He knew he wasn’t alone.  However, it wasn’t until he’d met Aria that he found out he was not alone in his status within the ranks of the very organization that hunted down the gods of old.

It was her cause that he boldly took up.  He was a man of power, he could lead where as she was resigned to the fact that people followed her.  But she didn’t have a cause, not in her eyes.  It was solely to keep the innocents alive.  She’d killed men and women like him, to protect her cover within the organization.  She even went after the Ascendancy herself, on the Regus’ orders of course.  She wasn’t presumptuous like that.  Sadly, she had predicted her own demise to that mission, knew one way or the other she was dead. 

But that, really is the middle of the whole thing.  Their meeting had been one of coincidence.  Eliot had of course seen the girl around.  She was around his age, born of and into the Atharim.  Her origins kept from her.  The world spoke to her in ways few could understand, and certainly no one within the ranks of the Atharim, for she was Sentient.  A being who could feel the emotions of every living thing on the planet.  Eliot didn’t completely understand the depths of her talents, but it had played havoc on her mind, body and soul.  She was a dark creature, a creature that should have been put down at birth, but there had been possibility in her, in her origins.  Her mother was Furia, she was a unique creature, Aria was.  And it was that uniqueness that opened her eyes to things that should have been obvious to the world.  Every life is worth saving.

Aria never valued her own life above others, she was a tool. To those she had known growing up, her teachers and caregivers, she was nothing more than a weapon.  She was trained to be Furia, taught to track in all ways possible, trained to kill and trained in all other things Atharim from the moment she could understand.  And while Eliot knew that it had shaped her to her core, she never once looked down upon the organization that had raised her.  Never saw what it had done to her, and never blamed them for her own choices.  But those around her, they did.  They knew if things had been different, she would have been different.  Naiveity was one of her short comings, but it was that same trait that allowed her to see past the rigidness of her teachings to see that the Atharim needed to evolve.

Sentient, wolfkin, furia and the godlings, were all worth saving.  Though she did have her limits with that, the law still mattered, the rules of humanity must be abided by.  Aria had no plans to fullfil the worlds need to bring justice to those deemed special.  But it has become necessary, and it will forever be needed, because more and more godlings are born every year.  It is what they worked towards.  The secret the Atharim try to hold on to dearly is slowly slipping from their grasp.

The story keeps moving from one truth to the other, but it all boils down to that one girl.  She was part of the greater revolution within the very walls of the Baccarrat Mansion.  And now Eliot, after her demise carried on.  The small army she had amassed was his, well not his, it was a free will sort of thing.  But still he commanded their moves with the grateful help of those closest to Aria, and even some who never knew her.

It has been 10 years since she left for better things, and today, well today it would end.  But you don’t want to hear about the end first.  So the story shall start in the beginning, the day Eliot met Aria.

****

Eliot was in the infirmary.  It was something Eliot did out of habit, he was alone, it was sterile and he was less likely to fall ill to what ever god-forsaken illness he had.  The doctors had gone through everything under the sun.  There were even major medical institutions that were researching his condition, and those very few others like him.  

A girl, no, not really a girl, she was 29 at the time, but her stature and her general demeanor made her very child like, she walked into the infirmary her dark hair flowing about her shoulders.  A gun and a sword hung at her waist.  If it were any place other than the Atharim infirmary it would look out of place.  Her eyes were the most startling green Eliot had ever seen.  The t-shirt and jeans that were under the long trenchcoat hugged her body like a glove, she was oblivious to the normal male reaction, or so Eliot thought upon first meeting her.  She had ignored his stares.  Eliot had no clue that the girl felt everything he did, knew exactly the feelings she intinced in men.  She didn't flaunt her assets, but she wasn't exactly hiding them either.

Underneath the t-shirt was the wound, it was bleeding through the shirt, and left a small dark spot upon the already black color.  There was no pretense, she removed her shirt and there was nothing Eliot could do but stare at her lack of modesty.  She looked at him with those emerald green eyes expactanty.  He studdered in starting and in his words.  "What happened?" he asked, he honestly didn't expect the truth.

It wouldn't be the first time the truth would be uttered from her mouth. It was something you came to expect of Aria.  She didn't hold back the truth, no matter how hard it was to hear.  She never outright lied to you, but sometimes she had better judgement to hold back the truth.  And it was the truth she gave him.  She'd just come from Mass, dinner and a snowball fight with Lucas, her friend.  He was at the time only a friend, though the signs of their relationship when she left this life were there.  

Aria had a gun shot wound to her shoulder.  It had been carefully tended before he ever saw her, but she had wandered in to make sure all would heal.  It was important that it heal, she needed to be able to fight.  Aria told him the tale of her fight with a man.  She had claimed the man, her father he said, came into her apartment to kill her.  She scared him off but not after he'd already fired a shot into her.  Though she was certain he had not been aiming for a not-so deadly wound.  

Eliot didn't know it at the time, but it was the day that Aria knew what he was.  Though she never told him that out right.  She'd hinted at it once and a while, that she'd known what he was before they'd actually discussed the issue itself.  

Eliot had grabbed the power from within.  The power raged through is body, the control it took to master even the most simplist weave of the power was oreous at best.  The weave was not complicated, but it could feel so on any given day, at least for him.  It was simply all five elements wove into a pattern, fire and water, air, earth and finally spirit.  Woven in just a way that would heal the interior of her wound, but not remove the visible signs. It had never occurred to Eliot that someone knew his secret, but that day Aria knew and she hadn't said anything to him.  Eliot hadn't known her secret then, didn't know that to a Sentient, a person dropped from their senses the moment the power was grasped.  There was a lot of things he hadn't known before meeting Aria and her friends. As far as he knew, Aria had never said a word to anyone outside her most trusted circle about his ability, his keen affinity to heal with the great power he was given.  She said nothing, not one word, she kept his secret till her dying breath.  Eliot had to wonder how many secrets she had taken to the grave.

Some secrets though, the world was coming to learn.  And some that were just now becoming beleivable, had always been there and had been there for generations.  The one true leader of the CCD, he was proof of it all, yet the world would go on beleiving that he had found the secrets to the fountain of youth, and he would never share that detail with the world.

There was a reason these men and women who could weild godlike powers were called gods in the ages past.  They lived very long lives, the power they could weild gave them that ability, they lived for centuries, making the mere mortals around them beleive they were gods, who were we to question those with awe-inspiring powers?  They were gods.

That was the day Eliot's life had changed.  Aria hadn't said anything, but it was the day that his life got turned upside down at least with in his own realm of thoughts.  But Eliot didn't know it at the time, it wasn't until months later when he had caught Aria and a friend discussing things.  She knew he was eavesdropping, he hadn't meant to, but her ability, it had told her someone was there.  

Eliot later understood what they had been talking about in hushed tones.  You see Nox was like him, and Aria knew, she had brought him into the order officially.  He'd been an Atharim his whole life too, except he was American.  Their presumptuous and outgoing nature and overbearing freedoms made their branch so much harder to control.  

Eliot knew that the current Regus was trying to gain control of their breathern overseas by whatever means necessary.  Eliot applauded their freedom, but he had agreed with the Regus, they needed control, maybe not their level of control, but official capacity, real connections within the government.  The Regus is a great man, however blinded by the zealous nature of their cause.  But he was a great man none-the-less.
