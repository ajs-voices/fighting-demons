The Baccarat Mansion was the jewel of the Baccarat collection, it was illustrious, the Tzars collection was displayed in all its fine glory on the first floor.  It was guarded day and night, the security was top notch.  The peices were set a drift among the construction designed to display the greatest peices Baccarat Crystal known to man.  

But underneath stood a vault of immense proprotion.  It was guarded by the same security that the crystal above was.  But inside this vault was not the treasures of the family business.  No, it housed an immense database and collection of raw books that went back ages, from the beginning of known time - as far back as anyone could remember, some said even further.  There were relics untold, and men and women who kept the aisle filled with study and knew the wonders it held.  They too were the treasure inside.

These men and women were much more than caretakers of lore and legend, they were the protectors of mankind.  Eliot Lagueux, walked the halls of his home.  He was a living heir to the Baccarat Crystal, but he was not THE heir, he would never run the company, he would never hold a title other than son.  He was not of that world, he lived in the shadows now, a hushed rumor on the wings of the aristocrats his family kept up with.  He was not a bane on his family, he was just a costly expense, until he made his worth known to them.

Eliot was the curator of sorts, he was the only living heir of the Baccarat throne that was left in the Atharim.  He was not a hunter, he was the caretaker of the money they donated to the society that kept the world safe from things that go bump in the night.

But there was a secret that the world did not know, a secret that Eliot kept dear to his heart, one that could mean his life, and the lives of so many others if it were to come to light too soon, if the timing were not correct.  Eliot was a monster of a whole nother breed.  He was a god! Or so the Atharim lore spoke of anyway, Eliot did not feel godly, he didn't feel special either.  He was what he had always been, a sick child of God who could not heal his own self.  The irony of his gift, he could heal the most fatal of wounds and leave not but a scar, but he could not lay hand on his own self, to heal whatever had ailed him his whole life.  But he was the monster within.

It had been a fateful day, the day he ran into a girl.  Her name was Aria.  She was stunning, she had the grace of a hunter, a wolf, she was after all trained in all thing Atharim. Eliot knew he was not alone in this world, he knew others like him existed, how could he not when he ran the latest headquarters for the Atharim.  He had direct access to everything Atharim.  He knew he wasn’t alone.  However, it wasn’t until he’d met Aria that he found out he was not alone in his status within the ranks of the very organization that hunted down the gods of old.

It was her cause that he boldly took up.  He was a man of power, he could lead where as she was resigned to the fact that people followed her.  But she didn’t have a cause, not in her eyes.  It was solely to keep the innocents alive.  She’d killed men and women like him, to protect her cover within the organization.  She even went after the Ascendancy herself, on the Regus’ orders of course.  She wasn’t presumptuous like that.  Sadly, she had predicted her own demise to that mission, knew one way or the other she was dead. 

But that, really is the middle of the whole thing.  Their meeting had been one of coincidence.  Eliot had of course seen the girl around.  She was around his age, born of and into the Atharim.  Her origins kept from her.  The world spoke to her in ways few could understand, and certainly no one within the ranks of the Atharim, for she was Sentient.  A being who could feel the emotions of every living thing on the planet.  Eliot didn’t completely understand the depths of her talents, but it had played havoc on her mind, body and soul.  She was a dark creature, a creature that should have been put down at birth, but there had been possibility in her, in her origins.  Her mother was Furia, she was a unique creature, Aria was.  And it was that uniqueness that opened her eyes to things that should have been obvious to the world.  Every life is worth saving.

Aria never valued her own life above others, she was a tool. To those she had known growing up, her teachers and caregivers, she was nothing more than a weapon.  She was trained to be Furia, taught to track in all ways possible, trained to kill and trained in all other things Atharim from the moment she could understand.  And while Eliot knew that it had shaped her to her core, she never once looked down upon the organization that had raised her.  Never saw what it had done to her, and never blamed them for her own choices.  But those around her, they did.  They knew if things had been different, she would have been different.  Naiveity was one of her short comings, but it was that same trait that allowed her to see past the rigidness of her teachings to see that the Atharim needed to evolve.

Sentient, wolfkin, furia and the godlings, were all worth saving.  Though she did have her limits with that, the law still mattered, the rules of humanity must be abided by.  Aria had no plans to fullfil the worlds need to bring justice to those deemed special.  But it has become necessary, and it will forever be needed, because more and more godlings are born every year.  It is what they worked towards.  The secret the Atharim try to hold on to dearly is slowly slipping from their grasp.

The story keeps moving from one truth to the other, but it all boils down to that one girl.  She was part of the greater revolution within the very walls of the Baccarrat Mansion.  And now Eliot, after her demise carried on.  The small army she had amassed was his, well not his, it was a free will sort of thing.  But still he commanded their moves with the grateful help of those closest to Aria, and even some who never knew her.

It has been 10 years since she left for better things, and today, well today it would end.  But you don’t want to hear about the end first.  So the story shall start in the beginning, the day Eliot met Aria.

****

Eliot was in the infirmary.  It was something Eliot did out of habit, he was alone, it was sterile and he was less likely to fall ill to what ever god-forsaken illness he had.  The doctors had gone through everything under the sun.  There were even major medical institutions that were researching his condition, and those very few others like him.  

A girl, no, not really a girl, she was 29 at the time, but her stature and her general demeanor made her very child like, she walked into the infirmary her dark hair flowing about her shoulders.  A gun and a sword hung at her waist.  If it were any place other than the Atharim infirmary it would look out of place.  Her eyes were the most startling green Eliot had ever seen.  The t-shirt and jeans that were under the long trenchcoat hugged her body like a glove, she was oblivious to the normal male reaction, or so Eliot thought upon first meeting her.  She had ignored his stares.  Eliot had no clue that the girl felt everything he did, knew exactly the feelings she intinced in men.  She didn't flaunt her assets, but she wasn't exactly hiding them either.

Underneath the t-shirt was the wound, it was bleeding through the shirt, and left a small dark spot upon the already black color.  There was no pretense, she removed her shirt and there was nothing Eliot could do but stare at her lack of modesty.  She looked at him with those emerald green eyes expactanty.  He studdered in starting and in his words.  "What happened?" he asked, he honestly didn't expect the truth.

It wouldn't be the first time the truth would be uttered from her mouth. It was something you came to expect of Aria.  She didn't hold back the truth, no matter how hard it was to hear.  She never outright lied to you, but sometimes she had better judgement to hold back the truth.  And it was the truth she gave him.  She'd just come from Mass, dinner and a snowball fight with Lucas, her friend.  He was at the time only a friend, though the signs of their relationship when she left this life were there.  

Aria had a gun shot wound to her shoulder.  It had been carefully tended before he ever saw her, but she had wandered in to make sure all would heal.  It was important that it heal, she needed to be able to fight.  Aria told him the tale of her fight with a man.  She had claimed the man, her father he said, came into her apartment to kill her.  She scared him off but not after he'd already fired a shot into her.  Though she was certain he had not been aiming for a not-so deadly wound.  

Eliot didn't know it at the time, but it was the day that Aria knew what he was.  Though she never told him that out right.  She'd hinted at it once and a while, that she'd known what he was before they'd actually discussed the issue itself.  

Eliot had grabbed the power from within.  The power raged through is body, the control it took to master even the most simplist weave of the power was oreous at best.  The weave was not complicated, but it could feel so on any given day, at least for him.  It was simply all five elements wove into a pattern, fire and water, air, earth and finally spirit.  Woven in just a way that would heal the interior of her wound, but not remove the visible signs. It had never occurred to Eliot that someone knew his secret, but that day Aria knew and she hadn't said anything to him.  Eliot hadn't known her secret then, didn't know that to a Sentient, a person dropped from their senses the moment the power was grasped.  There was a lot of things he hadn't known before meeting Aria and her friends. As far as he knew, Aria had never said a word to anyone outside her most trusted circle about his ability, his keen affinity to heal with the great power he was given.  She said nothing, not one word, she kept his secret till her dying breath.  Eliot had to wonder how many secrets she had taken to the grave.

Some secrets though, the world was coming to learn.  And some that were just now becoming beleivable, had always been there and had been there for generations.  The one true leader of the CCD, he was proof of it all, yet the world would go on beleiving that he had found the secrets to the fountain of youth, and he would never share that detail with the world.

There was a reason these men and women who could weild godlike powers were called gods in the ages past.  They lived very long lives, the power they could weild gave them that ability, they lived for centuries, making the mere mortals around them beleive they were gods, who were we to question those with awe-inspiring powers?  They were gods.

That was the day Eliot's life had changed.  Aria hadn't said anything, but it was the day that his life got turned upside down at least with in his own realm of thoughts.  But Eliot didn't know it at the time, it wasn't until months later when he had caught Aria and a friend discussing things.  She knew he was eavesdropping, he hadn't meant to, but her ability, it had told her someone was there.  

Eliot later understood what they had been talking about in hushed tones.  You see Nox was like him, and Aria knew, she had brought him into the order officially.  He'd been an Atharim his whole life too, except he was American.  Their presumptuous and outgoing nature and overbearing freedoms made their branch so much harder to control.  

Eliot knew that the current Regus was trying to gain control of their breathern overseas by whatever means necessary.  Eliot applauded their freedom, but he had agreed with the Regus, they needed control, maybe not their level of control, but official capacity, real connections within the government.  The Regus is a great man, however blinded by the zealous nature of the overall cause of their society.  But he was a great man none-the-less.

Aria and Nox were discussing him, but Eliot hadn't realized that at the time.  Nox had been in the infirmary with a gapping gash in his arm.  Something with in the tunnels had ripped his muscles and he had been in a lot of pain.  Aria had done what field triage she could, but as with her shoulder wound months before, Nox had needed his arm, and they wanted the proper attention. 

Eliot was not a doctor by any means but he knew enough, his parents had seen to it that he had gotten the best education he could, and when he expressed interest in medicine, he was given private tutors.  He never received the medical degree that came with his home studies, but money had bought him the knowledge, and the Atharim hadn't need to look beyond what his family name and their money said he was capable of.

The power had coursed through him when he had healed Nox of his interior injuries.  The muscles were healed as if they had never been harmed, only the wound on the outside could be seen.  Eliot had never meant a man with his power, or a woman for that matter, at least not knowingly, but Nox had, he understood what had happened.

Nox was telling Aria about him, about what he'd felt.  Eliot hadn't known it was him they were talking about, he hadn't heard that part of the conversation.  Nox had walked off in another direction when Aria rounded the corner and put her arm in front of Eliot's path.  He could plow through the small whisp of a girl, in reality he'd probably bruise himself in the process so he had opted to look down upon her.  The look in her eyes was not dangerous, playful, like a cat might play with a mouse.

And she was playing with him.  She knew so much more than her eyes could tell him.  At that very moment she knew he had been listening, knew what he could do, and she held all the cards, every single one, and Eliot was clueless to the situation he had been in.

She smiled up at him, completely unphased by the different in height, she'd been looked down upon by most in her life, in stature and in attitude, she was after all a tool, in her own eyes.  The tone in her voice conveyed the nature of her ruse, "And what are you doing, healer?"

It was one of those subtle hints, that Eliot had completely disregarded at the time, but looking back on it now, now he knew she was toying with his reaction.  Seeing if he understood.  He had not.  

Eliot's voice wavered as he spoke, "I didn't mean anything.  I didn't hear anything, not really."  He had lied, and she knew it.  That twinkle in her eye that said she knew was there, Eliot just hadn't know.  Every emotion, every thing he could ever try to hide from any one person, the girl saw through.

She nodded her head and the sarcasm dripped from her voice, "Sure."  It was an aggressive move on her part, she knew his secret, yet Eliot didn't know so when she grabbed his arm and pulled him into a room he'd not seen get much use over the course of his tenure as the caretaker of the vault.  But it was currently in use, books were scattered everywhere, a computer terminal light the room with its dim blue light.  There were articles pinned to the wall, strings drawn across things, making connections.  It was a place of research.  

Eliot glanced around and could not make heads or tails of the room, what was she doing?  What was she researching.  There was nothing in it that made sense.  His confusion must have been high on her radar, she smiled knowingly at him.  "So, you seem to have some skill.  Nox confirms my assesment of you."  She grinned at him, the cheshire cat came to mind, that evil smile of the cat who was not necessarily Alice's friend in Wonderland.  That smile should have been warning enough, but her words were cold and chilling.  "Not that I needed his confirmation.  We have different ways of knowing, but we both know, my dear curator, what you are."

The panic set in and Eliot's heart raced.  He could feel it pounding in his chest.  What he was... the words rang in his head.  He'd known what he was for years, nearly 8 to be exact by that time and place.  But she knew, and Nox knew.  The name sounded familiar, she'd mentioned it, but the name skipped through his mind like a flat pebble on water, never sinking in, not until that end, that final memory latched on.  The man he'd healed, the one she had been talking to.  
The questions darted through his mind, Eliot could not catch one, there were so many.  Finally, after the thoughts trickled through his fingers like water in a seive, he caught one, the question hung in the air.  "How do you know?"  He had said it in a whisper, not that there was anyone around to hear his utterance.

The smile turned from wickedly evil on the face of this girl, to something of compassion.  Of true understanding.  She put a hand on his arm and he felt the cool presence of calm, as if he'd been sent into some meditative state to regain his calm.  "It's alright."  She reassured him, calmed him.  

He pulled back from her grip with a realization, it was like a crushing blow to his stomach, he couldn't breathe, couldn't think beyond the weight of that moment of complete understanding.

This girl was Sentient, she could manipulate him could make him feel whatever she wanted, create false feelings in his mind that would linger forever.  At least that was Eliot's fear, she was manipulating him, bearing down on him to control him, his power.  He was horrified, the terror on his face was clear.  Eliot had backed himself up against the wall, he stared at her in abject disbeleif.  How could a creature so vile be within their ranks.  

And just as swift as a kick to his nether regions, another epiphany struck him, it was like all the fine crystal his family was known for shattered at his feet.  He was a monster.  He was with in the very ranks of the men and women who ultimately fought against the gods of old.  And here he was judging yet another creature of the dark - a human with a gift, a curse, a human who was special within their own rights.  Who was he to pass judgement, he was not God!

The funny thing was, that the girl watched him, she didn't look like she cared, she watched him with pain staking care, just watched him.  It was an eerie feeling being watched through the eyes of a person who knew what you felt.  Yet she herself showed no emotion at all, not an ounce, she was not afraid of him.  She was not worried about his reaction.  No she just watched, seemly with no outward reaction.  She waited patiently while Eliot processed the information that she already knew.

The thoughts raced through Eliot's mind like they were on the NASCAR curcuits of old, twisting and turning but always coming back to the same place, over and over again, the path predictable.  The moments passed, the dots connected, drawing a picture that he was failing to comprehend until they were all connected.

The pounding in his chest subsided and Eliot could finally take a deep breath, pull in the filtered air from the underground conditioners.  He pulled upon his power and Aria reacted, she took a step back and reached for the sword that lay under the trenchcoat, he'd nearly forgotten about the weaponry he'd seen and known she packed.  

She didn't draw upon him, but she was ready, how had she known he'd pulled his weapon, not that Eliot knew how to make it so, he'd seen the images of the battle in DV but he didn't know how to do any of it, not even an smattering.

He asked again, this time with less venom, "How do you know?"

There was tension in the air, almost like she was a rattler ready to strike, had Eliot known any battle weaves maybe she'd have reason, but she didn't know that, he at least had one advantage, however in reality it did him little good.  But she smiled at him, there was comfort in her eyes, they were dark, and deadly but she was showing compasion, she understood what it was like.  Her voice was soft, no longer cold and distant as before.  "I can feel it.  Nox can sense it."

With the words she sat down on the desk, removing her hand from her weapon.  But the air, it was still thick, still hard to breath.  She turned to the door as it opened.  Eliot wove a weave of air, and the man laughed.  He was tall, thin but he was built like an athelete none-the-less.  There was an impish grin on his face.  Aria nodded.  "Now if the two of you will please drop your power so that, Eliot can breath, I would appreciate it."

As the words finished Eliot could feel the room return to the dimly lite presence it had been before.  He looked at the new arrival as he leaned against the wall, his arms crossed and a michievous grin on his face.

"Sit, Eliot."  She instructed, there was no command in her voice but he felt compelled to do it.  What had she done to him?  Things rolled and swayed in his mind.  He slide against the wall, his legs almost giving way underneath the extreme weight of the situation.  The floor was could, he was bound to catch a chill.  

The man looked at him, that unnerving grin never leaving his face.  "I think he's scared of you Aria."  There was wonder in his voice, almost like what he said was some kind of mystery, a myster that Eliot couldn't fathom.  She smiled back at him, there was a bond between the two, he looked back between her and him, trying to comprehend things.  He had never so much as had a girl, but this didn't look like that, didn't feel like that, the way they postured.  There was no tension, just playfulness.

Aria smiled, "Eliot, let go of the power.  While Nox can probably take care of any situation you might throw at us, I'd prefer that our weapons be at rest."  As if she didn't have weapons to call upon.  He watched as she stood up, and removed the belt at her waist and set it on the otherside of the desk, out of arms reach.  She was trying to disarm him.  Trying to make him feel comfortable.  Disarming herself for his comfort.  

Eliot hadn't realized he was uncomfortable until she'd done so, and her insistance upon letting go his only tool made him all the more aware of the situation.  He was alone, with two hunters, two very dangerous hunters.  The man, Nox, again that name, but this time he remembered him, remembered healing his wound, he spoke, "Dude, I'd do as she asks, she's a bit stubborn like that."

He looked up at him, he towered above him now that he sat on the cold hard floor.  "How does she know?  How do you know?  Know what I am?"

Nox knelt down in front of him and whispered.  "I am one too.  Aria is a different kind of special.  You'd call her Sentient."  He grinned as he sat down, his legs folding underneath him like some flamigo or other long legged bird.  "You are gone from her senses, until you let go and she can feel you, sense your intentions she won't be open.  I can tell you things, and I can be a means to an end, but Aria she won't until you drop the power.  I know it's intoxicating, I know it's safe, but there is nothing to fear here, between hopeful friends and if not at least allies."

Eliot hesitated, he wasn't keen on the idea, but he really didn't know how to protect himself from others, he could try to physically fight them if it came down to it, but he'd end up broken and battered and there was nothing he could do about it.  He dropped the power and they both smiled.  "How do you know?"  He directed the question at Nox, he had already explained her reasons, but his was vague.

Nox grinned and the world became dark, the air hard to breath.  It was almost all consuming.  Nox, he spoke through the air, Eliot was surprised that he could ear, that waves could travel in the precense of this thing.  "You feel my presense."  And then it was gone, everything was as it should be, Nox continued without pause.  "I feel yours."

It was a slow comprehension of it all, Eliot opened himself to his power and Nox nodded.  "You understand," was all he added.  The look Aria gave him was one of satisfaction yet she disapproved as well.  That look made him weak, made him feel compelled to do as she said.  Maybe it was all in his head, but he was afraid of the girl, more than the man who could weild the power of the so-called gods.

She smiled, it was almost angelic, his mind was playing games on him.  Eliot still couldn't reach beyond his teachings, no matter how hard he tried, Sentient, wolfkin and yet he accepted what he was.  It was an internal battle he would fight it, he would win.  There really was no other choice.  If he told her secret, who was to say she would keep his?  He'd been living in peace for years and no one knew, no one even suspected to his knowledge.  And then more thoughts, what if others like this man knew what he could do.

She could feel his fear perculating to the top like the coffee pots he'd seen used on very old shows, the bubbling and the gurgling.  It was disquieting.  She smiled at him from atop her perch on the desk.  "It's alright.  Your secret is safe.  We won't tell.  As we have not told others like you of their secrets.  You are not alone."

It was a simple statement, so truthful.  And yet Eliot had wanted to rip at her for stating the obvious, of course he was not alone, he was not some new godling, new to his abilities, he was Atharim!  He was a god! 

The venom of his thoughts made him jump.  He was not a god, he was a man, a man with a gift.  The teachings and his own ego were playing hardball that day.  He accepted her words.  He accepted she was a monster too.  But it wouldn't be for more months to come that he would come to trust her with his life.

That day, the three of them spoke in hushed tones, Aria explained the notations on the wall.  It was subterfuge, she was hiding everything within plain sight.  And yet it was not obvious to him what the connections were until she made light of them.  It was like seeing into the window of a dasteredly mastermind.  

Nox was far less threatening, but he in reality should have been the person Eliot feared more than Aria.  He would, could and did do things just because she suggested them to him.  Whether she played head games with him, or he truly trusted her that much Eliot was never quite sure of, but of her inner circle, he was by far the most knowledgeable, and today is Eliot's most trusted advisor.  The trust Nox had in his own flesh and blood, his sister, who like him could weild the power of the gods, or goddesses in her case, was not rivaled by what he had for Aria in the end.  

It was the first day of Eliot's true calling - not as Baccarat heir, or even as an Atharim, but as a human.  He hadn't truly understood what the Atharim had fought against.  The reality of it all, was the Atharim brought down tyrants, not gods, not men and women who could channel.  But men and women who took advantage of their abilties and forced their will upon others.  They were the Hitlers and Mousslini's of their time.  Some would say that the Ascendancy was the same, he was a tyrant, but he didn't restrict humanity, he saved them.  But he was manipulative but he did not reign with iron fist, he reigned with govenrment, with council.  

It wasn't freedom Eliot saught.  It was hope, hope that life could and would be better.  That men and women like him didn't have to hide in fear and they weren't hunted down like a rabid curr.  

There have been many battles along the way.  Some Eliot would never know about, and some that he helped shape, and all because he had met one girl who had changed his life forever.

****

Sometimes the most wonderous things in the world are from the smallest of things.  Ants for example can lift more than five thousand times their body weight.  The questions arrise when things are made larger, but for Eliot, his cause, it started out small, it grew because he decided it should.  He may give credit all to Aria, but it was Eliot's cause, it was his leadership that lead the revolution from a handful to a great many.

Eliot started by searching out those like him, those men and women who had survived the sickness.  Eliot wasn't the heir to the Baccarat throne, but he had his own trust, his own money to pull from.  He funded these new hunters.  Not so they could kill a godling, or even a wolfkin or sentient and the furia who didn't stay with in the Atharim.  He would even go so far as to overlook a Rougarou who was surviving in humanity with out killing or death.  

It was only a begining for Eliot, the new breed of hunters he saught, they were godlings, if they were Atharim all the better, but if not no harm done.  He would teach them how to teach others.  Eliot had to find someone who could do it for the females, no matter how hard he tried, Eliot could not get them to understand the nature of their own gift.  

Thankfully, Aria had a friend, she had introduced her once, but had only said that she understood the cause, and she was there to help.  It was not the introduction he had understood at first.  Eliot was not one to pick up on the subtle hints of others.  Thankfully Aria when in private was rather blunt with him.  "She can help you teach women."  

It started a wonderful working relationship.  Tehya was born Atharim, she knew the situation he was in, knew what it was like to hide within the walls of those who hated you.  It wasn't that Aria didn't understand, it was that Aria accepted it, accepted that she was just a tool for the Atharim - to be disgarded once finished.  Eliot supposed it was just the way she was raised, but with as much empathy as she had for others, there was so very little for herself.  She never saw past the blinders, always seeing the Atharim as the only way of life.  It was all she knew, even when Lucas came into her life.

He knew what was what, he understood her, he got her.  Lucas even joined the Atharim just to be with her.  Eliot knew that Lucas' decision ate at her, but she was not going to disuade Lucas either.  It was his choice, he knew the fact,  Aria as Aria always did, insured you knew the truth, the cold hard brutal truth.  She told him, "The Atharim hunts monsters.  And monsters they can look like you.  They can be human.  Some are human but God deemed them worthy of a special gift, a gift of power or insight or the ability to channel the nature of a wolf.  You might be asked to do this job, to kill a man, a woman, sometimes even a child, a baby just released into the world.  To question the Atharim is to question The Regus himself.  And he has been known to snap the necks of men and women who will not do his bidding as he sees it."  And then she smiled at him, there was still hope.  "But there are men and women within the Atharim who do not beleive this way.  I am one.  And there is hope, possiblity of change.  It's small right now.  Only a handleful of us really, but all it takes is a pebble to start a ripple."

Aria had given the same speech several times over the course of the years after she'd met Eliot.  It never changed, it never waivered.  It was cold and hard and the complete and honest truth.  It inspired many, everyone wants to be part of something great.  The way Aria spoke, the complete and honest truth, it inspired you, and if it didn't, it would scare you away from the world of monsters forever, the hunt, the kill, the fact that monsters were real, and that you had to fake the whole rigid thing or else your life was at risk.  If Eliot had heard her speak that way before he became Atharim, before he knew what it was that he actually was, he'd have run for the hills, begged to become part of the Baccarat legacy.  But he hadn't, he had taken up the helm after his uncle and brother died.  

It was that which inspired him, their death to take hold of the reigns of the Atharim safe house.  To give hope and kindness to those that served and protected humanity.  He was no warrior, he was a sickly child all his life, running winded him, his limbs somedays barely even allowed him to stand for a good length of it.  

Everything we do shapes our lives, Eliot supposed that was just the way it had to be, for everyone to get where they were now.  To this momentous day.  The days events make it so very difficult to stay on task, to tell the story from the beginning.  The excitement that can be felt in the air is almost as thick as pea soup.  That fog that passes over everyone around you, even if they don't know what's coming, you do, it will be great and grand and it will be remembered.

Eliot has the CCD covered, he can get hunters whereever there was need now, now that ne had the mission.  He prayed no man or woman would fall vicitim to the Atharim, or the World Health Organizations probing, or worse yet to the Facility where God only knows what is happening there.  Though Eliot suspected a great many things, he never truly would fathom the depths of the secrets within.  But there were others, men and women who had survived the Facilities and are key players in the world we have at large.

A cop is going to run into all sorts of weird things.  There have been Television shows about that type of thing forever, but now, now these things they are real, and probably always have been.  One of the Cheif Inspectors on the CCDPD was one of few who didn't think people were crazy.  The Atharim didn't know at the time, but he'd started a small group of officers who were keenly aware of the weird things that could happen.  It took some time, and some connections, but Eliot found out and utilized these men and women to further his cause, and helped the Inspector make more of these 'anti-terrorism' teams.  They had the full support of the Ascendancy as well.  Which makes things all the more curious, all the paths crossing.  

Aria's pin up connections looked like child's play if you actually sat down and tried to see everything that was coming.  Even the Regus himself didn't know what was coming in the end, despite all his prophecy and scholarly insight.

The monster squad as they came to be known as internally had a reputation for making the impossible seem possible.  Ivan Sarkozy was first on the squad, he had a run in with Aria, he didn't know it, and neither did she, but they fought the same side.  But that was before Aria had found Lucas, and after she'd met Dane.  The Mockingbird to those who feared him was a monster that would require another story to tell, and he was a defining moment in Aria's life.

Eliot had neither met Dane or Ivan personally, but Ivan had the bad pleasure of meeting Aria they day she tried to end it all.  The risks she took, fighting an oni alone.  Not only was it stupid, she knew it.  Thankfully the hero that Office Sarkozy was, not to mention it was his job, he was there to save her, or Eliot might not have ever found the desire or the calling he now had.  At least not in time to lead it, to make it his own and carry on, bringing things to the culmation that it was today.

The world is such a small place.  Just knowing how many connections you can make to a person with out having to go too far.  It really is six degrees of separation.  A game that was played when 'Kevin Bacon' lived, how many degrees of separation where you from him.  The theory was that for everyone it was only 6.  Which boiled down you only having to meet 4 people in order to actually get to Kevin Bacon himself.  The world is small now, technology makes it smaller and smaller everyday.
